The premises are very peaceful and well maintained.	1
The apartment was spacious though basically equipped.	1
We enjoyed the fine pool and good food.	1
But the hospitality was overwhelming!	1
These people are so friendly and helpful that you'd never want to leave again.	1
After a small accident with a child that needed stitching in the hospital the brought us there and picked us up again and arranged some snacks during the waiting.	1
Arriving back at the hotel after midnight we found the complete staff waiting to welcome us and then preparing dinner.	1
Really a moment never to forget	1
5 min drive out of Pisa or you need to catch the Bus, too far to walk.	2
