Excellent location: by the railway station and Pisa Mover to the airport.	(The airport itself is understaffed and lacks sufficient infrastructure for the number of passengers.	On a busy day, arrive early; it took us nearly an hour to go through security.)	It's a twenty-minute walk to the Leaning Tower.	There are some good restaurants nearby, and the main shopping street is five minutes up the road.	The room was nicely decorated in light wood tones, the bathroom was fine, bed comfortable, and good sound insolation: no noise from the station!	The breakfast was Ok, I suppose, 	but NH breakfasts lag behind other major hotel chains.
The lobby is nicely decorated.	However, the room is big, 	but very out-dated.	Carpet was worn down.	It's right cross the train station.	If you close the window, the noise won't bother your sleep.	Breakfast was just average.	Bed was not comfortable.
Directly opposite the main railway station and 10 minutes from the airport by taxi or train.	Good double glazing so no outside noise.	Wide choice for breakfast in a bright and clean dining room.	No restaurant 	but plenty of places nearby and within easy reach of the tower and surrounding facilities.
Location is great, the train station is right outside, and its only a 15-20 minute walk to the tower.	The breakfast is one of the best selections iv seen in a long time.	The staff were very welcoming and friendly.	Rooms are a bit dated 	but for the price and location you cant really go wrong.
This hotel couldn't be more convenient for travelling through Pisa, as it's directly opposite the train station, and only a short walk from the airport.	The room was comfortable and quiet 	even though it faced a busy road.	It's not the most luxurious hotel, and only offers breakfast, 	but it's near to the restaurants in town and for a short stay it had everything we needed.There was some confusion over our having paid in advance, 	but this was all cleared up quickly and easily.
We stayed here for one night.	We arrived by train and you can see the hotel as soon as you walk out of the station.	Check in was fine and the staff were helpful, also providing us with a map of the area.	The room was lovely: clean and modern.	Breakfast was great and all well stocked and slickly run.I would definitely recommend staying this hotel and having read a few of the negative comments, consider them to be on the harsh side.	This was also very good value for money.
The good thing about the hotel is the location especially if you travel by train 	but that's about it.	Breakfast was OK 	but the room ( standard double room) felt rather cramped and there was no free Internet (the free WI FI connection in the reception area was slow).	Additionally there were stained carpets in the hall and a hole/dent in the room wall.	The bathroom was nice 	but there was a bad smell coming from the sink.	Overall, it does not feel like a 4-star-hotel.
Not sure why this hotel does not rate even higher: ideal location with train station across the road and, for instance, airport / duomo buses outside; staff efficient and friendly; large, clean, quiet, comfortable and cool rooms with excellent beds and en suite; an excellent and very extensive breakfast all for around 110 euros a night.	We use it quite regularly and it is always up to this standard, a standard that would and should shame many London hotels.	Just along the road is a good pizzeria while it's an easy walk to the shopping streets north and south of the river Arno.
Late flight into Pisa airport ( well after last train to Pisa centre) 	but a brief taxi trip took us to the hotel.	Excellent triple glazing meant that our clean, modern and functional room ( 	although the shower was a bit iffy) was immune from external noise from the street outside and station directly opposite.	Internal sound proofing not so good 	though!A good night's sleep was followed by an adequate continental breakfast.	Front desk stored our bag whilst we walked ( about 20 mins) up to the Campo for the Leaning Tower and the Duomo etc.We got a  good rate direct from the NH website which meant that our stay was very good value.	Picked up our bag mid afternoon, crossed the street to the station and made the easy train journey to Florence.
We stayed one night here as it's very handy for the train station.	The public areas are modern  airy.	When we arrived there was no-one at the front desk 	although they appeared fairly quickly.	The desk staff really need some more training in how to welcome guests.	There was minimal eye contact and a distinct lack of smiles which was all the more noticeable as we had just come from a really friendly small hotel in Florence.	The only words spoken to us were to tell us our room number.	A couple checking in next to us were greeted with only one word..."name?" Staff training urgently required.	Our room was of adequate size 	although there was no luggage rack for our suitcase.	At the front desk they seemed to be very surprised by our request for one to be brought to our room.	An unsmiling lady who did not speak to us at all did bring the requested item a while later.	The room seemed to be a mix of older furniture from the days when this was the "Jolly" hotel and attempts by NH to modernise.	The two don't quite go together.	The built-in clock on the tv was wrong by half an hour.....not much use if you have a train/plane to catch.	Good job we had a view of the station clock across the road.	Bathroom was lovely.	Plenty of toiletries etc.	Double glazing very effective so room remained quiet 	even though it directly faced the train station.	Breakfast area was well laid out with a very good choice.	Bus stop right outside hotel.
We stayed over the Easter weekend,we were in 410, the room was a little warm and the only way to cool down was to open the triple glazing which let in the noise, 	but that was our only gripe.	A very modern clean 4* hotel only 20 mins walk to the tower and 50 mins on the train to Florence, 20 min bus ride to Lucca.	Very efficient friendly staff, the breakfast was the best continental we have ever had lots of choice, only little bits out at anytime 	but constantly topped up so always fresh (could do with at least 2 coffee machines) Thank you NH for a lovely stay.
This ideally located hotel is across the road from the Central Station from which an 8  minute bus ride to the airport may be taken.	The building is a modern low rise with tasteful modern decor and superbly appointed rooms.	My superior room had a great bed, flat screen TV, kettle, safe and fridge/mini bar.	The in-room WiFi is extremely fast.The friendly staff are keen to help and happily provide maps of town with details of how to walk to the tourist spots.	The buffet breakfast featured a great range of cold foods, with a lovely variety of local specialities and a nice range of pastries and desserts.	There was also hot food- bacon and scrambled eggs- available.	The check out, by Nicola, was speedy, helpful  and friendly, as were all the hotel staff!	There were some minor faults or niggles, 	though- the key had to be reprogrammed daily, the room did not contain a T.V.	guide, the coffee supplies were not replenished and the very modern shower did not have a shelf for soap or gels to be placed, making showering difficult because the limited movement head needed to be hand held for better control leaving the other hand to hold the gel!	However, this hotel is a great place to stay if you visit Pisa!
1) Location- opposite Pisa Central Train Station so easy to get to other cities eg Florence.	very close to two buses for airport- Opposite the bus stop for airport (red line) and also close to Platform 14 for PisaMover- buy tickets from the tobacco newsagent shop in the station rather than driver directly 1.30 euro vs 2 euro)2) Good breakfast buffet of hot and cold foods- eg sausage, egg, pastries, cereals, particularly appreciated the interesting fresh juice selection (eg melon cucumber mint) 3) Friendly staff - booked a standard double 	but got an upgrade to superior- much appreciated (was told on check in it was because we had to wait for a while as the lady was busy with other customers however in retrospect I suspect this may be a mini apology due to the entry key card system being done for the time we were there!	)4) Clean rooms and free wifi.	Also had kettle in room which was an unexpected bonus :)Negatives: Key card entry system not working- this was down throughout our time there, so very inconvienient as had to wait to speak to reception each time we wanted to enter our room so they can send porter up to open room each time, made it feel very inflexible and awkward- this was never acknowledged by hotel - I suspect this is the real reason why the upgrade was given 	but would have been nice to have been told!	)overall still a good stay, would recommend for future stays.
It's a very nice surprise for an old Italian city to find such a good hotel in a logical price in such a great location.	It's opposite the train station and very close to the leaning tower.	Also you can find some small restaurants or fast food near the hotel.	Our room was very clean and pretty with great mattress!	If I ever visit Pisa again I'll certainly stay there!
This hotel is substandard in its services.	The manager who was in charge in evening is reckless and unaccountable.	The hotel has very poor wifi which is mentioned in many reviews.I want to make sure people read this review and stay away from this hotel for their own good.The water that that runs in the tub or even sink is muddy and brown in color.	When I complained about the water or even the wifi the manger was reluctant to do anything.His attitude was " I dont care" and " I cant do anything".	On top of that the manger said wifi is a privilege.	Seriously which world are you living in?	The NH group has no where you can give a feedback about its service which shows how little they care about customers.FOr the amount you pay and the so called 4 start rating, this is a messy place.
We stayed in NH Pisa for on night during late September this year.	We arrived Pisa by 11 am from London and we were travelling with a 3.5 year old child.	I asked the guy (Nieola) in the reception if we can get a room earlier than the normal checkin time of 3 mp as my son was bi tired.	We decided to drop the luggage and go for lunch before we can check in, 	but the hotel receptionist was very kind to offer us a room instead.	He did mentioned that as many people checked out in the morning there are fews rooms which are ready for checkin.	This was a fantastic gesture by the hotel stuff which was very unusual.	We have travelled through Europe during past 8 years and never been offered a room as soon as we walked in long before the schedule check in time.	The room was very clean and comfortable.	The air-con system was working fine and the temperature of the room was very comfortable.	The sleep quality was good, 	though the hotel was on the main street there was no issue with noise from the traffic on road.	The location of the hotel was great, it was on the opposite site of the Pisa Central Railway station which was connected to Pisa airport and other parts of Italy.	If you are travelling in train through Italy and Positing Pisa, NH Hotel is the best location you can think of due to its close proximity to the railway station.	The breakfast was good with lots of option to choose from.	The main attraction (leaning tower of Pisa) was within walking distance of 15 min.	Overall the stay in NH Hotel was a good experience and I will highly recommended this hotel for people with family.
Short walk from train station, beautiful hotel.Lovely staff, spoke English.	Stayed on fifth floor, lovely comfortable room, lovely linen, comfy bed, bathtub, safe hairdryer, fridge, mini bar, balcony over looking train station square, huge TV ( 	but only news in English) great air con.30 minute walk to leaning tower, passed many resturantants, shops, great clothes and shoe shops.	The walk to the tower is just lovely, just go out of the hotel and turn right then right again and just keep walking.	You will cross the river and then follow the crowd.	Free to enter the grounds where the tower is, 	but if you want to enter the buildings you need to purchase a ticket.Be aware of your bag at all timesThe leaning tower is just amazing.Also free wifi
This hotel has a perfect location, whether spending time in Pisa, or travelling to other cities, train station is minutes away!	Rooms are quiet, cool and comfy.	Nicola and Giuliana at the front desk were so friendly and helped me plan my day from what to do, to where to eat!	These days its rare to find hotel staff willing to take the time to assist their guests.	Thanks!!!
On perfect location traveling either by train or airplane (right next to Pisa railway station).	Room was very clean and comfortable.	Although room was facing the railway station and street, there was no sounds from the street.
When first booking this Hotel, I accidentally clicked on the wrong arrival date.	I rebooked the Hotel with the correct date and duly arrived.	I explained my predicament to the staff who were rude and unhelpful.	The Hotel has refused to refund the money for the incorrect booking.	The whole stay became an unpleasant experience.	There are signs everywhere in Italy saying beware of thieves and pickpockets.	I should have listened.
Is in an ideal place for the central railway station................As we planned to visit the surrounding areas we chose this hotel for it's closeness to the station ( no sound can be heard from the station).	The rooms 	although not massive are cool and clean and the bed is one of the most comfortable I have ever slept in.	The breakfast is fantastic with a vast choice from fresh fruit, cereals, cold meats, cheeses, hot food and pastries (something for everyone).	The staff 	although curt at times are very helpful.	Would definitely stay here again.
The hotel is located perfectly for exploring Pisa and surroundings.	We had a nice stay, and met only kind staff, especially the chambermaid named Mirella, who cleaned our room so well every day, and always met us with smile, and a "buongiorno"..
This hotel is far from a 4 star.	The room was very basic and needs renovations.	For 150usd per night, i could have chosen a much better one in Octobers which is not a high season.	The only good point is the location is just across pisa train station.	The room is at a motel level.	The staff are nice and helpful.I will not go back and recommend.
Comfortable room, bed and bathroom, mini-fridge available.	Unfortunately, a kettle/tee/coffee supplies are not provided.	The room was quite small for 2 persons, 	but otherwise great.	The location is just opposite the train station, so no any quizzes with finding a hotel.	About 25-30 minutes walk to the Leaning Tower.
My wife and I stayed at the Jolly Cavalieri Hotel Pisa - now part of the NH Group of hotels - for four nights late July.	I had a what I think was a good deal using the Active booking service - 320 euros on a BB basis.	The hotel is undergoing refurbishment and we had a room on the 4th floor which looked as it had only recently been finished , good size room , wall mounted flat screen TV , refrigerated mini bar , safe , modern bathroom , with bath and shower.Breakfast was a buffet style and was excellent with a very good selection to choose from.	We did not eat at the restaurant.The hotel is directly opposite the railway station, which made trips to Florence , Liverno and Lucca very easy.	Florence is a must, and Lucca is certainly recommended.It is probably 20 min walk to the  Tower from the hotel  , 	but buses are available.We ate at four restaurants / pizzeriasThe nearest was Da Michel, food was good , 	but not so happy waiter.We did find difficultly in finding a restaurant on Monday night, and finally ate at  Cafe Pisa  located very close to the Tower, good food and excellent service we would certainly recommend it.I stumbled across a pizzeria 5 mins from  the hotel , Le Scuderie, it is at the end of Via Del Carmine.	Great atmosphere , food and cheap house wine.	The pizza is charged by the metre .	Definitely recommended.
We read the reviews on the hotel before we travelled and they were pretty acurate.	The hotel room we stayed in was on the 5th floor and i would advise that you ask for a room on the 5th.It is state of the art and only just renovated.The view was great and an advantage was a balcony.	Even though you are opposite Pisa station there is no noise at night.The plus part to the hotel is that breki is good and it is excellent to travel around.The downside is that there are no other extras,no atmospere,no bar (	although you can order a drink 	but it is pricey).The reception staff were polite and helpful.Get the train from the airport,buy a ticket in the arrival hall before you leave (1.10 Euro PP) and it takes 10 min to the station.The taxis are expensive and public transport, be it train or bus is excellent.	The bus station is around 5 min walk from the hotel and a bus to Pisa Marina costs around 3.5 euros return.It is well worth the visit as well as historic Pisa as the beach front is great.A visit to Florence costs around 11.50euros PP return.great weekend had architecture mega impressive
Currently being refurbished 	but there was no disruption.	Modern, comfortable (A Con) and clean.	Excellent location for travel links (frequent city  airport buses stop outside, rail station is across the road) especially if you have an early flight as the bus or train only take 5 - 10 mins.	Very nice staff.	Great buffet breakfast.	Will happily stay here again.
We booking this property for a low 85 Euros a night on booking.com.The hotel was more than we could have asked for.	We arrived late (0100h) and tired.	The hotel reception were friendly and quick to check us in.	They gave us a complimentary upgrade to an incredible two-story suite.	The room had a lower level that consisted of a living room (two sofas and a couple of chairs) and a television.	The upper level had a massive bedroom and fabulous bathroom.	The bathroom had his/her sinks, a shower and a shower/bath.	The bedroom was really comfortable and had a brilliant sunroof.	The breakfast was served between 0700h and 1000h.	It was a nice breakfast, with a good view of the central train station.	The breakfast included a couple of hot dishes, yoghurts, fruit, breads, vegetables, and an assortment of hot/cold beverages.	We were impressed.The location could not be better.	It is directly across the street from the central train station.	Pisa's main tourist attractions can be reached on foot.	It is a short ride from the airport (accessible by train, bus or taxi).	The hotel also check our luggage for the day while we wandered about Pisa.	The hotel check-out is a leisurely 1200h.
Extremely convenient for travelling.	Right opposite to the Pisa Central Station.The room is clean, good size, bright and quiet even facing the station.The bathroom is well equipped.	The staff are friendly.	Breakfast is good as a city hotel.No teamaker in the room and the mini bar is fairly expensive.It will take about half an hour to walk to the Leaning Tower from the hotel 	but since there is no other places to go I rather prefer the hotel is near to the station than the Tower.	Very few choices of hotels and restaurants in Pisa not even a McDonald in the shopping area.	The city is no way as near busy as in Florence.	The Leaning Tower is really worth seeing.
This hotel was booked because it was convenient for the railway station.	Unfortunately its proximity to the railway station meant it was also adjacent to the bus station - not aware of railway sounds 	but noise from buses sitting below our window was intolerable for almost the entire night.	This was compounded by noisy inefficient so-called air conditioning - so window closed and no cooling air in the room.	We require and book twin rooms.	This room had two separate beds 	but they were separated only by the thickness of a bed sheet.	This does not constitute a twin.	Beds not comfortable, this especially noticeable because no-one was going to sleep in this room.	Service from reception staff was okay for a one night stay 	but it was nothing more than polite efficiency - disinterested staff.Breakfast suited me because there was greasy bacon to be had along with the usual fare.
After reading several unfavourable reviews,we were anxious about our jet 2 holiday in this hotel.We had no need to worry at all.The airport bus stopped right outside the hotel,10 minute drive at most.The gentleman and lady receptionists were pleasant and efficient.Our room wasexactly as shown on website,contempery design,comfortable bed and modern bathroom all spotlessly clean.Breakfast offered a lovely selection of fresh fruit,cereals,cold meats and cheese as well as hot ham and eggs and a selection of cakes,breads and pastries.The location of the hotel is so near to the bus stop and train station,making visiting Lucca and Florence so easy.The leaning tower is a 20 minute walk and delightful restaurants and coffee shops are all close by.We would not hesitate to book this hotel again.
The hotel location was ideal.	The transfer bus from the airport stopped right outside the hotel, and the hotel faces across to the railway station.	It was also an easy walk down to the river and the centre of Pisa.Our room was a fairly compact size, and newly decorated and furnished.	The sound-proofing was excellent.	The room faced onto the station and we heard no sounds in the room from outside.The air-con in the room was very effective and also quiet, making it comfortable in the room.	The range of lighting sources was good, and the room had enough power points for tablet/phone etc.Breakfast was variable.	The breakfast on the first day had a wide range of foods available, 	but there was less choice on our second day.	Food quality and freshness was good.Overall, the hotel was very good value for a breakfast and Wi-Fi included rate.	The only downsides were service at the front-desk was not very welcoming, and cleaning standards in the room were not perfect (dirt marks on some of the furniture).
Good location nearby the Central Station, so good for travellers.	Walking distance to the Duomo/Tower about 10-15 Min.WeÂ´ve booked a standard room - due to a/c-problems, we got a free upgrade on a superior room.	As the standard room is not quite a hit, at least booking a superior room is recommended.Breakfast buffet was very good, the service was fair.
Quite amusing to read about your own check in experience on Tripadvisor - and I'm not surprised to hear it took 15 minutes.	I must say that the drama and behavior of the male member of reception staff was absolutely the worst I have had the misfortune to encounter: and I have travelled a bit.	It seems his demeanour did not improve when he moved on to the next customers, from what they have said.	We arrived to the greeting of: "Passport!" Accompanied by an outstretched hand.	Followed by this, our passports were individually snapped off us and taken to the other end of the reception counter and details vigorously punched into a computer.	There was absolutely no other communication with us at all, aside from a few glares.	It was obvious, in my opinion, that the rude man was having a bad day and he certainly wanted to share it with everyone.	This attitude manifested even before the error in our booking came to light, which was a huge problem for him, and he sure let us know.	Then he left us with the impression we would have to leave and go somewhere else as they didn't have the right room (a twin) available.	His trainee (lady who seemed to be shadowing him) was clearly uncomfortable around his behavior and I didn't blame her.	The error was apparently something to do with the online system, 	but the fact is, the error wasn't in itself the issue for me - it was the poor attitude.	Here were two customers checking in who should have been dealt with politely.	(I booked a twin room, clearly shown on my booking form, and we were allocated a double.)	Enter Laura (the manager) who immediately reassured us that it was not going to be a problem that the wrong type of room had been allocated to us, that it could easily be sorted out, and she checked us in swiftly.	I could not see Mr Angry's name badge, which is a shame, as he deserves a personal mention too, really.	I told Laura I was  unimpressed with the behavior of her colleague, saying he had been very rude.	Later, I had cause to go to reception and he was polite, so I wondered if feedback had been delivered.	Although this hotel is clean and bright, 	although it is a stone's throw from the train station and taxis, 	although it is close to a host of great places to eat and have a drink, I could neither recommend it, not return because of this one person who left me with a very negative impression that I can't get beyond.	SUCH is the importance of customer service - or just plain politeness.
Conveniently located next to rail station.	I stayed 40 days for business on single superior room.	Although it was small 	but was clean, comfortable bed and sound proof windows.	The inclusion of safe and tea/coffee facilty was usefull.	Hotel staff were friendly however few could not speak English well.	But if there was issue they tried to help.	The Hotel rate ramped up due to holiday season.	Overall was OK for my business requirement.
Great hotel for a short break.	Ideally located 50 yards from main railway station, with connections to all parts of Italy.	Staff are very helpful especially Maria at breakfast.	Short walk (approx.	1 mile) to leaning tower.
Lovely hotel in a great location for a 4day visit to Pisa and the surrounding area.	Situated just across the road from Pisa central station, it really couldn't of been any better for our first visit to Pisa.	A shuttle bus operates from the airport to the central station, a short 10min or so bus ride, really easy and cheap.	The hotel staff were all really helpful and friendly and the bedroom was great.	A really clean hotel, brilliant size and comfortable bed.	All of the facilities were superb, really top quality.	Breakfast was great, fresh food and a wide choice of different foods, fresh fruit, continental ham, cheeses etc...just fantastic.	Would recommend anyone visiting Pisa to stay here.	Only a short walk to the shopping area and a walk away from the leaning tower...great, great, great....
This is a nice NH hotel in the centre of Pisa.	Right across the Central train station.	Walking distance from all shops etc.	About 20 minutes walk to the leaning tower of Pisa.	The hotel has rooms which are refurbished and these are great and modern.	They have a very good breakfast selection.	And it's not an expensive hotel.	So for a visit to Pisa, good choice for your hotel.
I usually stay in this hotel when I'm in Pisa.	The hotel is directly opposite to the Central Train Station and is close to everything, about 15-20 minutes to the tower.	Parking is available at the hotel or outside, both options are costly.Internet works better than many other places, 	but still slow and not reliable.	The room is nice and small.	Breakfast is very good.
The best thing about the NH Cavalieri hotel is that it is opposite Pisa's main train station, so it's perfect for travel to the airport (6minutes) or any other city in Italy.	I would have scored them slightly higher, if it weren't for the hotels and BBs we stayed in before my arrival.	The balcony on the 5th floor was nice and the inclusive breakfast (we got a deal) was good, too.Unfortunately for them, we stayed in 2 great hotels/BBs in Florence prior to our arrival and I have to say, the service at the NH was not up to par.	It was not terrible, 	but with the others - from the initial friendly greeting to the personal service we received throughout our stay, the NH hotel could not compete.While checking in, the NH asked me to sign up to their marketing scheme.	When I refused, they said it was not for marketing purposes, 	but to make checking-in easier the next time around.	Sadly for them, I've stayed at NH hotels before (and accidentally signed up to their marketing scheme) and every check-in is still long and laborious.	I also receive unwanted junk emails from them.The hallway smelled of cigarettes, 	but thankfully, the room didn't.	The bathroom needs a major overhaul to bring it into the 21st century.
Booked 1 night here in a standard room.	I was already aware that the main pictures of the rooms were of the superior rooms and not the standard rooms.	But the room we were put in was a new one so I assume a free upgrade was given!The rooms were clean and large.	The bathrooms were very modern and had a lot off free shampoos and soaps etc.	The breakfast was in the main restaurant which is nice and they served a wide selection of things.	The best breakfast throughout all my tour of Italy.	Overall id recommend the hotel for the superior rooms!	cant judge the standard ones having not stayed in them.	The staff are friendly and the place is very clean and central, opposite the station!
We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights in August  then again for 1 night at the beginning of September.	My husband  I booked a superior room for ourselves for all 3 nights  a standard room for our daughter  her friend for the 3 nights.	For the 1st 2 nights our daughter was upgraded so they also had a superior room, which was nice.	However, they did notice the difference when we returned for the 3rd night  they just had a standard room, which was in desperate need of a renovation - it appears that half of the hotel has been renovated, 	but not the other half.	Buffet breakfast was very good.	Hotel "bar" seemed to be permanetly closed.	Hotel was right opposite the railway station, so very convenient for on-going travel or days out to Florence, Lucca or the coast.	We took a taxi from the airport to the hotel which only took about 5 minutes and cost 10 Euros.	There were not many restaurants in the direct area, 	but we did find a lovely traditional Italian restaurant over the back of the hotel.	Approximately 20 minute walk to the Leaning Tower of Pisa, which is definitely worth a visit.
When we arrived the modern decor was promising and the concierge was initially helpful... to a point where he then stopped being interested!	We were quite early and they found us a room which was a nice thing to do except that it was a hideous, tiny, dated, smelly dungeon of a thing with a delightful view of the hotel's massive air-conditioning system.	It was stuffy too bc in spite of having a full view of the internal workings of the hotel's heating and cooling, our aircon was about as powerful as my great grandma's breath.	The bathroom was functional, just, 	but mouldy and gross in he base of the shower, furthermore there was a weird, rather cool stash of bathroom goodies in tangerine and lime that looked like it belonged in a hotel that cared.	The bed was potentially comfy had I had it to myself, 	but 	even though I'd requested a twin room bc traveling with my 8 y/o, we got a double that was really closer to a king single so we spent the night kicking each other.	Breaky was good I thought except devastatingly included only that disgusting percolated coffee from a 'stay hot' thingie and no real coffee...this is an absolute sin in Italy and cause alone for never going back.	It was insanely easy to reach from the station and equally easy to access the airport via 5minutely buses from the front door 	but they were the highlights....for gods sake don't go there for a romantic getaway!
My husband and I stayed in the hotel for one night on our way up north toward Venice.	We were coming from Rome via train and wanted a quick stop in Pisa to see the Leaning Tower and break up what would have been a very long train ride straight up from Rome to Venice.	We choose this hotel based on the fact that it was right outside the train station (literally across the street!)	so it was very convenient if you are coming and going by train.	Yes, as others have noted--the train station is kinda "shady".....	but what train station isnt?!	I dont think I have been to any major train station anywhere in the world that wasnt a little run down outside with some questionable characters hanging around.	We never felt unsafe and the hotel also felt perfectly safe.	Yes, it is a bit of a walk to the Field of Miracles, however if you make it part of the experience, it is a very easy and enjoyable 20 minute walk that will allow you to see the rest of Pisa aside from the only major tourist attraction in town.	As for the room, we loved it!!	I booked a regular room (which I am sure is one of the disgusting ones people have posted pictures of) however, upon check-in we were upgraded to the superior room--the ones advertised on their website.	It was very modern, clean, and spacious with all the amenities you could ask for.	The breakfast buffet was included in the price and it was a generous spread by European standards--including eggs, fruit, breads, cheeses, and cereals.	The free internet in the lobby was also a plus!	I would recommend this hotel in a minute!	It was the one I questioned most before arriving due to other reviews, yet out of the five hotels my husband and I stayed at while in Italy, it was our favorite, and unfortunately we were only there for the night.
Bus from airport stops right outside the door.	Hotel right opposite the station.There was no noise from outside, which did surprised us..We stayed twice, the first time we arrived early , however they had a room ready 111 which was lovely, cherry wood.The second time they stored our luggage until the room was ready.	The room was very large, a disabled room, 	but needed updating.	(hairdryer needs re-positioning when they update room -far too high)  staff were helpful and polite, good location for transport
If you are travelling to Pisa by train the hotel is literally outside the train station and you can't get any closer to it.	The hotel is fairly new looking and modern and the room was very clean.	We only stayed one night 	but it was fine.	It took about 20 minutes to walk to the Tower.	We arrived in the morning and they were kind enough to hold our luggage in storage for us until the room was ready.	Wifi was very fast and it was very quiet in the room, considering it was right outside the train station.
We booked this hotel quite a time ago and on coming were surprised to learn that due to overbooking our room will be available only by 8 p.m. That made us to change our plans substantially.	The staff was very kind to suggest us a "complimentary excuse", as well as a small discount, and at the end the room was not so bad.	Although the breakfast was not of the regular NH quality we are used to).	Anyway this will not prevent us from using NH hotels!
We stayed here for 2 nights in May.	The front desk staff were helpful; the bus for the Leaning Tower leaves from immediately outside the hotel and one of the receptionists showed us a good walking route back to see the main sights.	We then spent the next day in Lucca travelling by train.	We had asked for a quiet room and 	though our room on the 5th floor was at the front of the hotel facing the busy square by the station we heard no noise.	Our room even had a little balcony with a table and chairs.	We thought the breakfasts were excellent and again the staff in the breakfast room were very helpful.	We would stay here again
A really nice hotel, decor was modern, bed was comfortable and our stay was a pleasant one.
First of all the hotel.	This is the second NH hotel Iâ€™ve booked, the first one was in Rome last year and I like the chain.	I booked a superior room and it was fine 	although they put us in one with a disabled bathroom.	Good walk in shower 	though.	The breakfast was a bit disappointing compared to the Rome hotel 	but it had fruit, cereals, meat and cheese and eggs and bacon and croissants.	They serve from 7am to 10.30am which is great if you are on holiday.	Overall the room and the hotel were clean and efficient.	Now for the location.	Itâ€™s great if you want to travel around as itâ€™s just across from the train station and bus station.	We went to Florence, Lucca and a little place on the coast called Viareggio.	Like all train stations there are homeless people in the vicinity and if you are put off by them then itâ€™s not the place for you.	If you are looking for somewhere more romantic then you will have to stay near the tower.	However, once youâ€™ve seen the field of miracles and the centre then there isnâ€™t much more Pisa has to offer so itâ€™s a trade off as to what you want.	The airport is really close to the town too which is handy.
We booked the hotel for one night incl.	breakfast, before an early flight out of italy.	We were positively surprised by the room.	The location is good, as everything in the center is in walking distance (campo about 20 minutes).	A big minus was the service.	We asked if we could get a breakfast to take out the next morning, as it was included in the price.	The only answer we got was: This is not possible.	Over there is a coffee mashine, where you can get acoffee in the morning.
A nice clean hotel opposite the railway station (also 5 minutes from the airport).	Good things are that the room was clean, the deal was reasonable and everything worked.	not so good was that check in seemed to take an age, the bar was totlly soulless, and the bed cover was minimal so I froze.	Breakfast was fine 	but nothing special
We have stayed in this hotel a number of times over the years, and have noticed improved room facilities and considerable refurbishment.	The location is excellent for what we need, being a 10 Euro cab fare (this hasn't changed for years!)	from the airport and facing the square outside the rail station.	Rooms are bright, modern and airy, 	though not all face the Piazza.	If you just want an overnight stay, it's perfect.	Also, a short train ride away is the wonderful old town of Lucca, where you can wander on the top of the old city walls the meander through the narrow streets.	If you're lucky, like us, there'll be a market taking place.	The one we enjoyed was devoted to antiques.If you want to visit the tower, baptistry and cathedral, it's approximately a 30 min walk past shops, restaurants and other squares, with the bridge over the river Arno splitting the walk into two halves.	Easily managed unless you have serious walking difficulties.One of the best features of the hotel is its restaurant - generous helpings of seriously good food, wonderful service and an excellent wine choice.	We planned our last visit after 2 weeks in the Tuscan hills to finish with a lovely meal and a bottle of Vernaccia.	Unfortunately the restaurant was closed that night (a Saturday) and the always friendly, efficient staff were most apologetic, 	but no-one could offer an explanation.	Luckily there are other restaurants in the vicinity, 	but they're really not a patch on the Cavalieri.	Shame!	But better luck next time we hope.
I really enjoyed my stay in this hotel, if we considered the room and the great bathroom.	The breakfast was ok and with plenty of choice.Regarding the negative aspect, and the reason why I do not rate it better, it is concerning the way that the reception handles your arrival and departure.	They were not really warming and provided me a card key that did not work.	When I went to the reception so they could activate the card key, not even an apologize or a work regarding their mistake.If you go for the rooms and do not mind regarding the customer service, this is a perfect hotel.
When your greeted like they do not want you there it's s huge problem This hotel does not offer any porter service we had to lug our bags up to our rooms Room was small breakfast was the best part No information there breakfast was or any other facilities
My room was the size of a postage stamp.	I met another single woman traveler (on the train to Siena) who stayed at this hotel as well, and we both came to the same conclusion about this hotel.	- definitely did not look like the corporate website photos.Without question, the hotel is centrally located.The room amenities were ok, the soaps/shampoos were probably the nicest part of the stay.	Breakfast was good.	Internet usage was intermittent.	I would probably not stay there again simply because I expect more for what I paid.
I stayed there for one night with my family.	We booked two rooms, one of them with twin beds.	At the arrival, there was no possibility of twin beds.	Ok, they offered us a suite for four people instead which was indeed a loft with a living room in the lower floor and two beds with two complete bathrooms in the upper floor accesible through a spiral staircase.	It sounded perfect.	When we get into the room, the airconditioning didn&#39;t work.	The upper floor of this lovely loft-suite does not have any window to the street, so no fresh air.	I phoned to the reception and the sir at the reception told me that "it was my feeling, because the airconditionning worked perfectly".	All this with a smile, of course.	I insisted, the maintenance guy came and indeed he agreed with me that the aircon didn&#39;t work.	It was like a microwave oven ( August, Italy).	I phoned again to the reception to exige another room.	I just got an unintelligible speech in italian English, quite upset, italian style, and finally hung me up cutting me short.	I felt like a .....(imagine the word).	Finally, after some minutes, I received another call telling me that, misteriously, there was another suite for four people.	I visited it and the aircon worked perfectly, so we took it.	Frankly, Additionally the area is a very bad one.

I've only stayed one night in this hotel and rate it based on my general impression of Pisa as town.	The hotel is perfect for stopover (it's right in front of the train station and only 9 euro away from the airport by cab).	It is not what I would choose for longer stay or a touch of luxury.	What you get is a small room with antique tv, depressing bathroom, 	but clean bedding and semi functioning shower and WIFI.	Breakfast basic 	but fresh.	Regarding Pisa as destination -  I've just cancelled the rest of my stay.	Poor, run down surroundings.	Not much to do after seeing few buildings.
Beautiful hotel, exactly what you'd expect from a chain 4* hotel.	I did have low expectations due to the tripadvisor average score of 3.5*- I don't know why it is so low.	Breakfast was included and had lots of choice.	Staff were helpful and explained how to get around the city.	Location was perfect- right next to the train station (you can see the hotel from inside the station!).	My only problem with this hotel was that it was in Pisa.	It isn't really a nice place.	Stay one night if it is convenient for the airport and see the tower, then leave!	If you aren't flying from Pisa, I would really recommend a day trip.
Modern hotel just across the road from the railway station, Stayed one night in August as we were then traveling  on to Florence by train.	Room was clean and  bed was large and comfortable.	Breakfast was ok, Italy is not in my experience know for good breakfast.	Carpets on landings and corridors stained and dirty.
I spent one night in this hotel.	It is just right in front of Pisa central station.	I traveled with my parents so they just put one extra single bed in the room.	The room was nice and clean.	Only thing I would criticize is front desk staff.	I didn't feel they were too friendly.	There were no smile on their face.	But other than that, it's a nice hotel.
Great reception staff.	Faultless check in and friendly welcome.	Everyone on reception  were very  pleasant and welcoming.	Our safe would not open one night and after a quick call to reception the nice man came up immediately to try and get it sorted.	Stayed for five nights.	Room clean, functional and adequate for our needs.	Bathroom was nice and clean with plenty of hot water for the shower.	The beds were very comfortable.	Shame only enough tea and coffee left for one drink.	Would have been handy to have had a couple of drinks each day last thing at night and one for the morning.	Close to the station which enabled us to explore Tuscany by train.	Florence, Cinq Terre, Sienna and a twenty minute walk through the town to the Duomo and Leaning tower.	Plenty of restaurants in town.	I would not recommend the cafe's near the hotel.Hotel was nice and quiet despite being near the station.	No noise in the hotel at all which enabled us to have a great nights sleep.	Breakfast was well prepared and easy to help yourself.	The only down point I would make about the hotel is that  they do not offer meals in the evening only breakfast.	There is a vending machine in the lobby area 	but it would have been nice to have had a nice meal in the evening.	You can have a quick breakfast before 07:00 or afterwards up to 11AM or 12 on Sunday or something more substantial after 7.All the staff we encountered were very cheerful and helpful too which was a bonus.	I would have no hesitation in staying here again!
Myself and daughter stayed for 3 nights from April 2nd 2017, we had room 409 overlooking the train station.Not much storage space, small wardrobe, which did have a safe in, 	but no drawers so had to keep items in case.Bedside tables didn't even have a drawer in.The room got so hot at night it was hard to get any sleep, when I mentioned it to reception they just said the air con isn't on in April.With rooms as hot as they were I think it should be available all year, we could hear other quests complaining about it too.Location was good, so handy for train station, and we walked everywhere from hotel.
NH hotels tend to be reliable and if you are using Pisa station then this is a good place to stay.	Not the best neighbourhood 	but that is typical of areas around stations.	Room was comfortable if small and everything you need.	Breakfast a little standard and unexciting Service was good especially from reception.	Good business hotel
Stayed a night in the NH Pisa and I thought it was better than expected.	Modern design 	but with a bit of a chain feel.	Rooms were comfortable and shower was good.	Location was great - very close to station.	Much better than what the reviews made it look like.	Main drawback was how long it took to check-in.
We have stayed in several NH Hotels previously and this hotel is extremely disappointing.	The room is ok - it is a standard room and the bathroom is a bit tired and grubby.	There are some water marks on the ceiling and walls leaks from the upper floors.	No tea making facilities.	Location is fantastic 	though as it is very close to the station and city centre.	But, most disappointing is the disengaged attitude from the reception staff and lack of bar/24 hour facilities.	There is a vending area in reception which has very little stock: no cups for coffee (and despite requests these were not replenished), no fresh fruit etc.	We have ALWAYS enjoyed our stays in NH Hotels 	but not this time.
I booked a non-smoking, "superior room" 	but there was absolutely nothing superior about it - have a look at my photos.	When I entered the room, it was stinking of cigarettes so I returned to the reception to ask for a different one.	I was told by one of the employees that "it was a non-smoking room 	but maybe people smoke in it" (???)	- the most ridiculous explanation I'd ever heard in my life.	He wasn't really interested in solving my problem so I just had to return to my room and keep the windows opened for some time.	I don't smoke so sleeping in such a stinking room was VERY unpleasant for me.	I found numerous cigarette marks in the room (see my photos) so obviously it was a smoking room and the way the receptionist lied to me was just unprofessional and simply rude.	The "superior" bedding turned out to be an ugly black blanket  a white sheet - neither comfortable nor very hygienic.	The "superior" shower didn't work.	The staff in charge of the breakfast were very welcoming and really seemed to care 	but the breakfast itself was rather poor - a few slices of ham and cheese, some scrambled eggs, milk, yoghourt, croissants and that's mainly it.	It doesn't sound very bad 	but it's supposed to be a 4-star hotel so I was expecting much more.	In a nutshell, I can't imagine why this hotel has 4 stars and, mind, my experience is based on a stay in a "superior" room, I can't even imagine what the standard rooms look like.	I don't recommend this hotel to anyone, unless you like to be ripped off.
My wife and I stayed in this hotel for a week in November and found it an excellent place to base ourselves as, being so close to the station, it was easy to go on trips to Florence, Livorno and Lucca, as well as forays into Pisa.	Being so easy to access the hotel from the airport is another big plus in terms of easing the hassles of traveling.	OK it is not in the centre of town 	but walking or taking the bus into and around town gices you an excellent feel for Pisa, its people, and the way it works.	OK the rooms are small, 	though perfectly adequate, and the staff friendly and helpful.	An excellent and tasty breakfast spread of options was a welcoming way to start the day.	The hotel appears to be hard used and therefore could do with a bit of freshening up, such as corridor carpets.	Although the rooms are generally well cleaned, serviced with excellent beds and bedding there is a lack of attention to cleaning in corners.	If I get back to Pisa again I would most assuredly stay at this hotel again.
Check in quick and effortless.Room  tired decor, 	but clean.	The bathroom a bit mildewy and 3rd bed, really just slung in by the window.Workmen started angle grinding and hammering at 9- 7 in the room opposite :( Breakfast not included, so costs 15 Euro each unless you go elsewhere.Not much to do or eat at in the area, 	but good transport links.If I did my holiday again I would stay at viareggio and travel to the sites from there.
My overall experience was OK: welcoming staff, stylish lobby and breakfast area, and an overall feeling of efficiency.	On the other hand, a big plant running 24/7 in the backyard was a bit noisy and my room looked somewhat tired: everything was in good order 	but the furniture has a distinct vintage feel.	Only a handful of power sockets were available, mostly of an old type which doesnâ€™t accept modern travel adaptors.	Despite some minor glitches, a pleasant stay.
We booked this hotel based on the reviews, past experience with the NH brand and its location.	The hotel is situated right across from Pisa Central Station (main entrance).	As soon as you step out of the station you will spot it.	The hotel itself is clean and quiet despite being across the station.	The room we were allocated had a  balcony and a view of the station.	We were on the 5th floor so we had a good view.	The room itself could do with a little bit more wardrobe space, particularly for those of us who are staying more than one night, and could do with some racks for luggage bags to make it easier to pack, repack, unpack etc.	Other than this minor criticism the room was clean and the bed comfortable.	Free wifi is available and works fine.	We had breakfast in the hotel (we went for the included breakfast option).	The pastries are good and the selection is wide, plenty of fresh salads and tomatoes.	There were options for juices, cereal, teas and coffees, plenty of options for vegetarians, and there is rice milk as well.	To get to the leaning tower, itâ€™s a very quick bus ride, we asked the reception staff who told us that the bus goes just across the road, (in front of the railway station).	You can get a bus ticket from the tobacco shop in the railway station.	It is about 5 mins by bus to the leaning tower.	The hotel is close to several small mini markets where you can purchase water etc.	Just outside the hotel there are some vendors selling various things like scarves, handbags sun glasses etc.	It is quite easy and possible to walk to the main town centre area of Pisa from the hotel, it is about 10 mins to the river and just across the river is the main town centre.	There are many restaurants and ice cream (gelato) vendors in the main centre, as well as bars etc.	Most restaurants in the town centre open around 6.30pm / 7.00pm for dinner, however the bars offer some food.	Overall the hotel was a good option, and would be happy to stay again if we returned to Pisa
I love the NH chain generally and this hotel generally does not disappoint.	It is 1 minute to the train station and we had a room facing it, 	but there was no noise evident.	AC and WiFi both worked well and complimentary breakfast was good and varied.	We had a room on the 5th floor with a balcony, which was nice.	So while there are many good points about this hotel, 	but equally it is not special.	If you are visiting Pisa, its a 20 minutes walk to the tower.	If you are using Pisa as a base to discover Tuscany by train, this is ideal.
This hotel is opposite the Pisa Centrale train station which is ideal if you are city hopping on your holiday or if you want to head away for a day trip.	The lobby is modern and clean and the staff welcoming.	The beds are huge, I was expecting a double/twin and we received a super-king which was great and very comfortable and is quiet at night with no train noise.	Minor cons would be the breakfast (fair range 	but to be honest not all that appetising in my opinion) and the shower-over-bath's glass screen only partially covers the shower's spray so you end up with a wet floor - other than those minor faults, would definitely recommend.
We picked this hotel because it is directly across the street from Pisa Central train station.	Check in and check out was easy.	Our room was clean and quiet.	The beds were comfortable.	Tower of Pisa is about a 20-25 minute walk 	but we opted for the bus (10 minute ride) which is located right in front of the train station.	There's also a small grocery store close by and a bunch of restaurants.	Definitely recommend this hotel.
Stopped here for convenience for our flight from Pisa.	Near to the train station, clean entrance and welcoming staff.	We left our luggage there before check-in whilst we explored Pisa.	The room was a bit small 	but a good price with good facilities.	Breakfast was nice 	but don't expect a huge selection.
The Hotel's location is really good, we stayed 2 nights, it is right opposite the main station (where we took the direct train to Florence, around 8 euro for a single adult ticket).	The hotel is also within walking distance to the leaning tower of Pisa.	We flew to Pisa airport from London Heathrow, there is a frequent bus service to and from the airport and pisa central train station (around 1.30 euro if you buy the ticket at the airport or you can buy ticket on the bus for a little bit more).The hotel staff are very friendly on average.	When we were going to the room, we noticed half of the corridor is new and modern and the other half is old.	Unfortunately, we got put to the old half and no surprise, our room is very dated inside and small also (	but relatively clean), unlike the main hotel photos, which showed a very modern green colour themed room.	Our room does have a big flat screen tv which we didn't use, a mini bar, no kettle, a very old looking safe and a small wardrobe to hang our coats.Inside the room, there are windows which you can open very wide, enough to climb out easily.	The room we had was really warm, we tried not to open the window when we sleep as we didn't feel safe to leave it opened all night, we turned the heating off and yet it was still too warm.	I called the reception twice, first time they said they will check, we then went to sleep with the ''air condition/ heating'' switch set to 10C 	but then we woke up in sweat during the night.	I then called the reception again 	but was told to turn the heating off (which we did earlier that night 	but had no effect in cooling the room) and there was nothing else they can do.	We had no choice 	but to leave the window open for the night, I did not sleep well that night and a little disappointed.
Across from train station.	Would be noisy with window open.	Room is small 	but bed was very comfortable.	Room and bathroom were clean.	Carpet was a little worn.	Wonderful buffet breakfast in large room off lobby.
Would happily recommend this hotel.	It's not a hotel full of character and history 	but it is a modern and very adequate hotel for a couple of nights in Pisa.	It's is opposite the train station (which links to Pisa Airport in 8 minutes or Florence direct in 1 hour) and is about a 20 minute walk from the Leaning Tower.	The walk is along a dead straight road with shops and eateries and no cars are allowed so it is a nice walk.The breakfast buffet was very good with a great variety of food.	The receptionist was helpful and pleasant.	The room was clean and well stocked.	Modern.	Nice shower.	Not huge room 	but enough for what we needed.	Hairdryer in bathroom pretty good too.I can imagine people worrying about noise from trains, 	but I honestly did not hear anything and wouldn't let that put you off.
Good for arrival and departure as it is next to the station.	A long walk to the leaning tower 	but the town is very pleasant so no problem.	Standard quality 	but clean and adequate.	Internet very very slow 	but free.
location is the best, it's very close to the train station, so surprise it just located opposite to the train station !	the room is decent and clean, friendly and helpful staff as well, we certainly enjoyed the breakfast,which was included in our package, everyday.	Having stated all the positives above, the only cons is you have to get the wi-fi login name and password from the front desk every 24 hours, overall a nice accommodation that is icing on the cake of our fantastic visit of Pisa....
check in not until 3pm, friendly staff, right outside train station we had lovely standard room for 1 night , they had special offer on for evening meal for â‚¬19 p.p which we ended up with ,it was lovely and after pricing loads of places as we walked from the tower, we found it to be one of the cheaper options for eating out.,left too early for breakfast, bus to airport is at 5.15am right outside the door so that was great as it was pouring down, â‚¬1.50 approx per person fare can pay the driver or get ticket in the ticket macine, 5 mins to airport, 15-20 mins walk to the tower through the shopping streets, buy ticket first at ticket office before queing at the tower as ticket will give you a time to queue at.	also you have to leave shoulderbags/bagpacks at the ticket office they are not allowed in the tower, 300 spiral steps to go up 	but there are little parts to stop every 50 steps or so.	you only get 1/2 hour in total up and down to take photos before you are asked to leave, hence your time on the ticket.	â‚¬18 per person to see tower and cathederal, the other venues are extra.
Stayed here for a night and was happy with it.	The location is handy as it is right beside the train station.	It's about a 15 minute walk to the leaning tower.	Some of the rooms are newly decorated and some haven't been re-done yet.	Our room was an older room.	It was clean and spacious.	Breakfast was ok, nothing special- some croissants, cereal, tea/coffee.	I would recommend this hotel, it was good value.
A pleasant hotel right near the train station.	The room, 	although slightly small was very clean-as was the whole hotel- with a bed that was so comfortable!	Staff were very friendly and attentive 	although at times there didnt seem to be many of them around!	Good location for the sights if you want to go and see the tower etc.	Just jump on LAM Rosso and your there in 10mins- it will pick you up right outside the hotel!Didnt try the food 	but looking at the menu I was glad we chose places in the town each night of our stay as the choice was quite limited.	We would stay again if in the area.
Spent 3 nights here with daughter so that we could visit Pisa Florence and Lucca.	The hotel is opposite the station so made travelling easy as plenty trains to these locations.	Train from airport or Red Bus.	As Pisa is quite compact it was an easy walk throught the centre of town to the Tower etc.	There are some nice shops enroute and a variety of restaurants.	Around the hotel is a bit grim after dark, 	but the hotel itself is very nice.	The staff were very helpful and the rooms very modern with flat screen TV and plenty storage for a short stay.	The Bathroom was a bit of a nightmare as with no shower screen the water went everywhere, 	but the hairdryer was good and the bathroom a good size.	The public area are light and airy and the bar prices fair.	The breakfast provided good coffee fresh juices,fruit,cereals as well as cold meats and bacon and eggs.	We did not like to be out after dark as the area around the hotel seems to attract a lot of people with no apparent reason for being there which unnerved us.	During the day there are a lot of sellers who were annoying rather than intimidating 	but nevertheless not welcome.	We would not stay in Pisa again 	but much preferred Lucca 20 mins away by train as it was quieter and more traditional.
Stayed for one night before heading off to Florence for Easter weekend.	Nice hotel, staff, clean rooms etc.	Location is ideal, just opposite the train station.	However, it's not very pleasant to walk to the main street in the evening, lots of people hanging around and found it a bit intimidating.	The hotel is on a very noisy piazza 	but we were impressed that the double windows completely blocked any street noise out.Ended up eating at the restaurant in the hotel because of this and really enjoyed the food and service.	Check your bill carefully when you check out 	though as we had American breakfasts and all sorts added on to ours 	though.	Issue very quickly and efficiently resolved, however.	Overall, a decent hotel that did the job.	We would recommend.
Fantastic place to stay.	Very nice, modern hotel on a very convenient place.	Airport bus stops in front of the door on the regular bus stop, railway station just opposite the hotel.	Only one disadvantage: quite a busy place.	Breakfast excellent, hotel decoration as well.
As other reviewers state, hotel is right by station.	The good breakfast and comfortable bed slightly made up for the substandard room we were allocated - one that sorely needed decoration.	I've had better rooms in Travelodge.Unless you have really heavy luggage, use the Bologna hotel (10 mins walk from station) as we did on our outbound journey.
A reasonable hotel, very convenient for station 	but 20 mins walk to Leaning Tower etc.Small room 	but Ok for one night stay.	Bathroom a little dated 	but clean.
It's not realy good, 	but fun for a couple of nights before leave .	Walking to the closest train station  is  (1 miniute) and in 20 minutes you walk to the hip and nice entertainment district .	However, next time I would chosse a hotel in the city centre .
Flew in from London before taking the train to Florence the next morning.	Rooms were better than I expected clean and big.	The bathroom as well!	!Everyone we dealt with was very nice and you can't have a more convenient location for the train station.Happy with our short stay.
NH Pisa is a nicely appointed hotel ideally placed opposite the central station.	I stayed in a superior room which 	although relatively small provide all necessary comforts; excellent bathroom, wall mounted TV with a range of European channels including news channels in English and a kettle with a small supply of tea and coffee.	The hotel is positioned on the opposite side of the river from the Leaning Tower, 	but is accessible by foot.	The breakfast buffet is plentiful with a range of hot and cold items.	There is a self service area in the hotel lobby that provides ready meals and snacks and a range of drinks, 	but there is no bar.	There are a range of bars and restaurants close by.
The hotel is located very conveniently to the train station.	The rooms were modern and clean 	but lacked a hotel safe (which is unusual for a hotel of this category).	However the main problem I faced was the service from the front desk staff, which I found rude, uncaring and completely unacceptable.	In one instance, the front desk staff actually ignored that we were waiting to ask a question and did not even look up when asked.	From our experience, I find it hard to recommend despite the convenience of the location, especially if you are tourist and may need to seek help from the staff.	I've received much better service from other hotels and would have expected much more from them.
I like this hotel a lot.	We stayed there for 1 night.	First we got free upgrade and got a lovely room on the last floor with a balcony.	The room itself was small 	but very clean and modern.	The bathroom was very beautiful and all hi-tech.	I would also say this hotel had the best breakfast variety from all the hotels we visited in Italy.	Far from boring "continental" breakfast.	It had even lactose-free milk (I think it was rice milk).The location is also great, since it is less then 1 minute walk from the railway station and 20 minutes walk to the Leaning tower.	I would recommend this hotel.
Stayed here for 5 nights and what an excellent location.	We came out of the airport, caught the red line bus which stopped outside our hotel literally 5 mins later and opposite the Central station.	Location was ideal for getting a train to Florence, Lucca and Cinque Terre plus a 20 minute walk to the Leaning Tower.	As for the hotel itself, the rooms were clean and beds very comfortable and with the double glazing no noise at all to be heard from outside.	We were on the fifth floor at the front so had a small terrace which was nice also.	The staff were friendly and breakfast really good, bacon and eggs which tasted really nice and perhaps better than it looked, pastries, yogurts, cereals, continental meats and cheese, etc etc, certainly more than enough to set you up for the walking around.	Cannot fault this hotel, very good value for money in a fairly expensive place to stay.
This hotel is in a great location literally across the road from the train station.	It is just a 5 minute bus ride from the airport to the station so your holiday can start quickly after landing at the airport.	It is a nice walk of about 20 minutes to the Tower and Florence is about an hour away by train.	We had a Superior room with a small balcony overlooking the front to the station, 	but were not affected by any noise at all.	The room was quite small 	but the bed was comfortable and the bathroom clean and modern.	Breakfast was great, plenty of choice.	Staff all pleasant and helpful.	We struggled to find a decent restaurant to eat in in the evenings 	but it was the middle of October so I guess a lot of places had closed for the winter.	However once we got to know the place a bit more, there were restaurants, you just had to look for them.	Would definitely stay here again and recommend to anyone staying in Pisa.
This hotel is superbly placed for the railway station.	It is directly opposite, making traveling around Tuscany by train that much easier.The room was nice and the help yourself buffet breakfast was very good, with a good choice of everything.	Where this hotel falls down is that it does not have tea and coffee making facilities in the room.	Also the coffee machine at breakfast is too busy and it is not the best if you want a cup of tea.	It could also benefit from a bar and restaurant 	although I understand they were in place up to 2015 so wonder why they were removed.The staff were very helpful and friendly and we have to say a very big thank you to Giuliana on reception for going the extra mile.
This hotel is very well placed for the airport with the bus stop literally right outside the hotel and the central station opposite.	We walked to all the sights easily from here, shopping on the way.However, the walls in the rooms are so thin you could hear coughing, the TV etc.	Although the room itself was well appointed, there was insufficient space in the bathroom to put your toilet bags, there was no where in the shower to place soap or shower gel, the extractor fan in the bathroom did not appear to work.	The location of the hotel works, it was nice to be able to open the double doors to let the sun in 	but the noise became too much after a while.	There was a reasonable amount of choice for breakfast 	although it would have been nice if staff brought coffee and tea to the table, instead of guests having to queue for a long time to use the coffee maker which kept stopping after dispensing a few cups.Not sure if I would stay here again 	but the location of the hotel is good.
The hotel is in an excellent location, directly opposite Pisa Centrale Rail Station, so excellent for trips to Florence, Siena, Lucca.	It's about 20 minutes walk to the Leaning Tower, through the shopping and restaurant area of Pisa.	We had a 5th floor room, with a small balcony looking out on to the small piazza in front of the rail station.	The room was clean and functional, 	though a little cramped, and there were no facilities in the room for making hot drinks.	The air conditioning in the room was very good, and allowed a sound night's rest.	The choice of food and drink items at breakfast was good:  breakfast was available 7 - 10 am weekdays, 7 - 12 weekends.
Really nice modern hotel, staff were friendly, hotel was spotless and breakfast was very good, plenty of choice.	We stayed here one night and found the location very good for us .	It is 5-10mins in a taxi from Pisa airport and straight across from the train station.	We walked to the leaning tower and found it easily, the city sight seeing bus stops across from the hotel which would also be good if you were looking to do this.	If we were to go back to Pisa would book this hotel again, great location especially if you are getting the train to go onto another city.
NH Cavalieri is very nice, modern hotel.	Location is good, very close to railwaystation (Pisa).	The personnel is very friendly and helpful.	Room was very clean and well equipped.	The only discomfort was the late check in.	We arrived a little bit before 01:00  pm and we were promised to get our room not earlier than 03:00 pm.
Fab hotel, excellent customer service, lovely rooms, good selection at breakfast and excellent location.I have stayed many times at this hotel in Pisa and no other hotel in the vacinity compares.The quality of this establishment is excellent and having spent other trips staying elsewhere in Pisa , I would always come back here.
What a delight to get off the train and just have to walk 200 meters to the Hotel, especially having to cope with suitcases.	The hotel stored our suitcase whilst we went to Cinque Terre for 1 night, allowing us to take a small backpack each!Hotel Cavallieri were so accommodating.	Gave excellent service, advice and help.	Our hotel room was lovely.	Clean, quiet and comfortable.	Nice toiletries for the bathroom.	No tea/coffee facilities in the room, 	but coffee freely available near the reception after 12 p.m..	Excellent breakfast.	Although it is close to the train station, it was quiet.It is within about 15 - 20 minutes walking distance from the Leaning Tower of Pisa  Cathedral.	A great walk as there is so much to see en route.	The hotel recommended a delightful restaurant for supper that evening.	A lovely stay.	We highly recommend this hotel.
