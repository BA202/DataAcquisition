The premises are very peaceful and well maintained.	The apartment was spacious 	though basically equipped.	We enjoyed the fine pool and good food.	But the hospitality was overwhelming!	These people are so friendly and helpful that you'd never want to leave again.	After a small accident with a child that needed stitching in the hospital the brought us there and picked us up again and arranged some snacks during the waiting.	Arriving back at the hotel after midnight we found the complete staff waiting to welcome us and then preparing dinner.	Really a moment never to forget
5 min drive out of Pisa or you need to catch the Bus, too far to walk.Beautiful self-contained apartments, well appointed with plenty of space, very clean.Great pool area with spa and massage area downstairs.
My family of 5 stayed at the residence San Rossore for 8 nights.	We had a great time mainly due to the pool, friendliness of the staff, and a good base for exploring.	(The attractions in Pisa, Lucca, Florence, and the Beach)The villas are huge and very functional which is a key requirement for a young family.	The kitchen mainly comprises of a hob and a fridge so is fairly basic.	We tendered to eat out most nights so this wasn't a problem 	but when staying in had no problem with cooking pasta from the local 'deli'.	The apartment only has Italian TV therefore those travelling with kids may wish to bring a Dvd player or laptop for their evening entertainment.	The Italian breakfast served in the bar area was a tasty and leisurely start to each day.
