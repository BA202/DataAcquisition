The premises are very peaceful and well maintained.	The apartment was spacious 	though basically equipped.	We enjoyed the fine pool and good food.	But the hospitality was overwhelming!	These people are so friendly and helpful that you'd never want to leave again.	After a small accident with a child that needed stitching in the hospital the brought us there and picked us up again and arranged some snacks during the waiting.	Arriving back at the hotel after midnight we found the complete staff waiting to welcome us and then preparing dinner.	Really a moment never to forget
5 min drive out of Pisa or you need to catch the Bus, too far to walk.Beautiful self-contained apartments, well appointed with plenty of space, very clean.Great pool area with spa and massage area downstairs.
My family of 5 stayed at the residence San Rossore for 8 nights.	We had a great time mainly due to the pool, friendliness of the staff, and a good base for exploring.	(The attractions in Pisa, Lucca, Florence, and the Beach)The villas are huge and very functional which is a key requirement for a young family.	The kitchen mainly comprises of a hob and a fridge so is fairly basic.	We tendered to eat out most nights so this wasn't a problem 	but when staying in had no problem with cooking pasta from the local 'deli'.	The apartment only has Italian TV therefore those travelling with kids may wish to bring a Dvd player or laptop for their evening entertainment.	The Italian breakfast served in the bar area was a tasty and leisurely start to each day.
We stayed here for a couple of nights on the way down to Tuscany  needed somewhere that was clean  had a pool.There seem to be very few hotels in or around Pisa that have pools  are reasonably priced.	This fits both bills.	The apartment was clean, and there was a bar in the hotel itself to get drinks, snacks  a well priced breakfast at 5 euros per person (croissant, coffee, juice  cereal).It had wi-fi which was 5 euro per 24 hours.It also had parking  was well situated to visit Pisa  the coast.All in all, it was basic, 	but perfect for an overnight stay.
The accomodation was simple 	but more than adequate.	Spotlessly clean and very spacious.	pool area was very pleasant - the highlight was the level of service.	Thanks to Petra for sorting out a mix-up with the booking and letting us check out in the afternoon on the day we left.	Great ceentre for exploring Pisa and the surrounding areas.
We booked this accomodation with a group of six people for our stay in Pisa during a conference.	Although the accomodation was quite far from the city centre and the conference center, it was easy to get there by bus (only 1 euro) or taxi.	Petra was quite happy to help you arrange a taxi or provide you with any tourist information.	She was very friendly and helpful, always smiling and really gave us a pleasant and welcome stay at the residence.	We enjoyed having to opportunity to have a quick dive in the swimming pool at the end of our day before going out for dinner.	The appartment was clean and spacious.	As we did not have a car, the supermarket was quite a bit of a walk.
The Hostel is in a pretty good location, about a 15 min walk from the airport and the directions were pretty good.	and then about a 10 min walk to the Tower and only a 2 min walk to the train station.	The Room wasnt the best, we stayed in a female dorm on the ground floor and didn't seem very secure, the room door didn't have a lock and the front door of the hostel was open all the time.	The room had a locker for everyone, however the one we were allocated didnt lock.	Not the cleanist place, I got bed bugs here.	The bathrooms werent the best either, there was 2 dorms on the ground floor and only 2 bathrooms.	There was no water pressure at all, had to have a cold shower.
While travelling around, I spend one night in Station Pisa hostel with 3 friends.The 4-bed room we had booked was clean 	but really simple and the beds were 2 bunkbeds, no problem for us 	but might be a problem for other age groups.	The bathroom was shared with another room 	but clean as well.	It's location is perfect, between the airport and the centre, on the other hand Pisa is a rather small city, so everything is in walking distance.	As far as I saw, most people in the hostel were young travellers, which is also the age group I would recommend this hostel to.	The receptionists were nice and helpful with everything we needed.	For the price of 50 euro/night for a room for 4 people, it was more than expected.	However, I wouldn't recommend it for people who want to travel with luxury, just for the ones who need a simple, cheap, clean and convieniently located place to stay.
the place is clean and the staff friendly 	but three big minus: 1. they charge us (3 persons) ten euros meanwhile other guests in the dorm told us that they paid seven euros 2. and it was too hot so we hard couldn't sleep.	Imagine how it is in the summer!	The ventilation is bad.3.	we couldn't sleep neither 'cause there's a highway right next to the hostel so we heard all night all traffic rush by ;-((
I just love this place - not only because of charming &quot;Adonis&quot; Carlo and funny &quot;Entertainer&quot; Giovanni and their honest advice &quot;make it your home!&quot; It definitely felt like home, cause the atmosphere was relaxed and personal and from the beginning the guys carried over the italian way of life.	The rooms are basic 	but totally cosy and clean and  the free espresso is just superb, especially when Carlo is preparing it with lots of love.	;))) The hostel is about 5 minutes to town and in case it rains while you stay there - just ask Giovanni to order the best pizza in town and enjoy it with a glass of good italian vino, because sharing is a matter of course with these great hosts.	I`ll come again and not only because of Pisa - 	but because of two guys, who love what they do and deserve success and happiness.	THANKS guys!
My friend and I went to Psa just to hang out and take pics of the Tower and go to other cities in Rome.	We had no clue about hwere to stay.	We stumbled on Hostel Station at the recommendation of a person we met in a restaurant.	I have stayed in Hostels before; some are nice 	but others can be really bad.	This one was WONDERFUL!	The staff were so accommodating and fun.	They laughed with us and met our every need!	The rooms were clean and nicely decorated.	The location was great; a five minute walk to/from the train station, five minute cab from the airport, five/ten minute cab from the Tower.	There are even bikes to use if you want to pedal around the city!	I would recommend this Hostel for young travellers as most of the residents were in their 20's.	The Hostel Station was a perfect solution and we even stayed two nights after having so much fun there the first night.
Wanted to stay in the hostel for two nights together with some friends.	I have stayed in many hostels before 	but this was the worst ever.	When I woke up I saw bed bugs on my bed.	Stitches on my whole body.	It was so itchy!	Please do not stay in this hostel to avoid spreading those bed bugs to other hostels or your home!	The bathroom was old, the shower was cold and unhygienic.	I stayed there in octobre and there were some strange people in the hostel who were definitely no backpackers or tourists.	It was very loud at night because of the railway tracks behind the hostel and the motorway.	I liked the free wifi and the dinner 	though.	The location  was okay: close to the airport and station 	but a little far from the city centre (~35 min walk).	nevertheless: absolutely disgusting!
Difficult access to the center by public transport.	The same applies travel to/from the airport between 22.00 and 6.00am.	Internet only in lobby, which is not good in the hotel who watch the standards.Very good breakfast.	Possibility of receiving snacks from 4:00 AM, which does not happen in other hotels.
Somewhat hidden away on the first floor of a 19th century building, 	but only 5-10 minutes stroll away from the Tower and Duomo, this lovely family run hotel is very welcoming and a great base for exploring Pisa and other nearby towns e.g.	Lucca is only about 30 mins by train.	Great to wake up to frescoes on the ceiling!No meals are served 	but the Filter cafe across the road serves fantastic food and gives a discount to Galileo guests.	Free wifi.
The stayed late to welcome us.	Taxi mix up took us to the Hotel Galelei - which is a very different place.Simple rooms on the second floor or and old town house - much like other places we stayed in Italy.	Not the most modern - 	but if we wanted that we'd go stay at a Marriott.	Rooms were clean and reasonably sized.One small peeve was the towels which were more like dishcloths - did the job ok 	but no fluffy.	Handy for walking to the tower etc.Was fine for a single night which was all we needed in Pisa.
I stayed at Galileo for one night.	I dont really know how they got 4 stars.	The photos dont show the reality: is a first floor of a old building, bad decorated.	You can hear everthing from other rooms, or in my case, from my room, i would wake up everytime someone would enter the hotel.	And for me the worst point is definitely the lack of cleaness, cause I think is totaly unacceptable to pay the price you pay and notice that the floor, the bath arent clean.For being fair, i would have to say that the girl at the reception desk was nice and kind, and that was the only positive thing.
Spent two nights over Easter.	Francesca gave us all the information we needed, from best time to do the tower, to where the best bars for happy hour were!	Rooms are beautifully decorated, flat screen tv, fridge and lovely newly decorated bathroom.	The only issue was with our room being next to reception, we could hear people coming and going late at night and early morning.	However, still very good value.
This is a very good hotel to stay in at Pisa.	The location is fantastic - it is about 500 m to the Square of Miracles, easy walking distance.	The staff were amazing - full credit to Francesca for friendliness and helpfulness.	The rooms were clean, tidy and comfortable, of decent size, as well as the bathroom.	The only downside was that my room faced onto the street, and late night partyers/ early morning traffic did wake me up, so sleep quality wasn't the best.	I do recommend this hotel 	though, it is a very, very good stay.
This hotel is in a great location, very central.	We were staying just one day in Pisa and we easily walked the city from here.	The rooms are basic 	but charming with an old world pretty style.	Dont miss the ceilings!	The bed was really comfortable.	The staff were really friendly and very helpful, I absolutely recommend this hotel if you are going to Pisa.
The hotel offered Great service, excellent  hospitality and nice, clean rooms!	The style was completely medieval and puts you in the Toscany mood.The location of the place is totally central- a few blocks from piazza dei milacoli!
A very basic room 	but for the price it was really good.	Very clean and really friendly staff.Shared bathroom down the corridor which would not suit some people 	but was very clean.Our room overlooked a side alley which was very noisey during the night as well.Excellent location for the Tower and Cathedral however as well as the area for the bars, restaurants etc.20 minutes walk from the train station to avoid waiting in the Taxi rank.Reception closes at 8pm so you will get a key to the front gates and a key to the front door, as well as a key to the room and a key to the bathroom.
At first we thought we were going to have a bad stay: either I booked by mistake a room stating it was for 1 or there was an issue with the system.	The lady told us we had to pay extra.That said, when I should her that the room costed the same whether for 1 or for 2 people when booked online, she called someone and everything was fixed.The room was really nice.	The bathroom, private, was outside the room.	I enjoyed that a lot as given the space constraints, it gave privacy as well as kept the moisture from the shower out of the room.The location is awesome.	Half way between the Tower of Pisa and the downtown area.Fantastic value!
The hotel was helpful in giving me instructions to access 	but note they do not have a front desk past 8pm which was a bit odd.	I couldn't get the wifi password to work.	The hotel room was very clean and huge.	My double bed was two single beds put together, a bit weird.	The shower was ok and bathroom was clean.	The trouble was the mosquitoes.	I literally couldn't sleep as they kept buzzing in my ear.	They are everywhere and the visitors book included people mentioning this.	Not sure there's much they can do about it 	but it ruined my stay and left me very tired and bitten the next day.	Certainly would not stay again for this one, very important reason.
This hotel is what you would expect of a typical Italian home in the city .	The room was large and the furniture was rustic which is why I chose this particular hotel .	Rooms were clean.	Easy access from the airport , we arrived late so the bus only went to the train station 	but it was only a short walk of perhaps 15 minutes to the hotel from here .	The leaning tower was a short walk from the hotel as were a good choice of restaurants .
This is the perfect hotel for a stay in Pisa.	The rooms are quite basic 	but the feel of the hotel is really nice and the staff go out of their way to make you feel welcome.	We arrived early 	but they let us into the room anyway, which was a great help as we had heavy suitcases.The hotel was in the next street to a vegan takeaway place (perfect for us), and only a short walk from both the Tower and the river.There are probably more luxury hotels out there 	but this was nice and cheap, and the staff really couldn't have done more to make us feel at home.
I was so surpised by how nice hotel was.	It was amazing!	Very clean, toilets are modern and clean, staff was very very helpful and friendly!	Very close to pisa tower and all the surroundings (5 min walk) and only 15 min walk away from Pisa Centrale station which can take you to many other cities (very reliable).	A true gem!
If you want a hidden gem ...you just found it!	Francesca and her family will reward you for staying with them by treating you with warmth and generosity ....if you are after a relaxing simple and beautiful stay..this could not be more highly recommended!Ps the family have become lifelong friends :)
We changed our minds at the last minute and decided to spend a little more money on a hotel more centrally located, this turned out to be a great decision.	This hotel is still very reasonable considering its location and rooms.	We stayed only one night, arrived very hot and bothered, 	but the hotel was a breath of fresh air.	Our room was spacious and beautiful - the fresco on the ceiling was amazing and there was a lot of space for a city centre hotel.	There was no air con in the room which was a minus point, 	but after a short game of charades with reception they produced a big fan for us pronto which was perfect.	No breakfast, 	but they give you a voucher for a cafe across the street where you can get breakfast for 2.50 if you so desire.	Tip: there is an AMAZING little snack spot if you come out of the hotel, turn right, and head about 150-200 to a small square.	It's straight ahead of you, blackboards outside advertising sandwiches.	Go in and pick one-  great selection of lovely meats and you can also help yourself to some local wine.
Had a great stay here and everything was marvelous!	From the hosts (Francesca) to the beautifully large rooms!	Great location near to train station, the leaning tower and the old part of the city!	I would recommend this to everyone...Pisa is great!
For us Hotel Galileo was in a perfect location, close to the old city centre and 5 â€“ 10 mins walk to the Leaning Tower.	There were lots of cafes, gelaterias and restaurants nearby.	We had booked the triple room and the room was very spacious.	Everything was clean and the beds were very comfortable.	The room had character and high ceilings, however,  the walls were a bit bare and some pictures would have been nice.	The bathroom was also clean, seemed to have fairly new fittings, and the shower worked perfectly.	Some minor criticism:  towels were a bit strange; the face towels were like napkins and very hard.	Also, the room was right next to reception, so you could hear everything that was happening there and was a bit noisy on the first night.	Francesca at reception spoke very good English and was really helpful, giving us tips about where to go and what to see in Pisa.	Thereâ€™s no breakfast at the hotel, 	but they have an arrangement with a cafe down the road where you can get Italian breakfast for â‚¬2.50.We were very happy and recommend this accommodation.	The price was â‚¬75 per night which I thought was good value for a triple room in such a central location.	Itâ€™s not luxurious 	but had everything we needed.
This was a good hotel because of its location,  it was near the Arno River and we were in Pisa to see the Luminaria.	However it was five to ten minutes away by taxi from the Pisa Centrale.	On arrival we were surprised that it had no lift so you would need to bring up you luggage up three flights of stairs.	The rooms were not airconditioned 	but because it had high ceilings it was still comfortable.	Please make sure to bring insect repellants if you want to be able to open the window.	The ladies in the front desk were very helpful and friendly.	We would probably stay here again 	although maybe not during summer.
This is the second time I have stayed here as an overnight after arriving at the airport at the start of a holiday.	The taxi fare is steep at 10-15 euros 	but really there is not an easy way to get there otherwise.	The hotel is impersonal 	but clean and offers a very good choice at breakfast: it is an eat all you can and stoke up for the day ahead type of breakfast.	There is a noisy road outside so it depends on which side of the hotel your room is to how this may affect you.	It is very possible to walk to the centre of Pisa in about 20-30 mins.	There is a dual carriageway outside and the pavements is not continuous on both sides so you will need to cross.	I noticed a small supermarket had opened on the route in to town since my last visit so one could buy food for a picnic perhaps.	Would go there again in the same situation as a woman travelling alone.
I am very comfortable with the daily.	It is a very well maintained hotel.	All clean.The staff is very friendly.Metro is just around the corner.	Very central.	The hotel manager Mohamed is very nice and gave us the feeling to be given at home.	Thank you for all.	I come back.	This hotel is very recommendable.	The Rooms and the Bathroom is very clean and very nice.	all excellent;)
Very close to the old town near the tower and church.	Also, easy access anywhere, via bus stop outside hotel.	ticket to central train station can be bought from the tabbaccini across the road.lots of eating places.	lots to see.	Staff was very accommodating, especially Francesca, - Any request made was quickley seen to.
I can highly recommend this hotel.	Although one shouldn't expect a luxury entrance or other star-hotel-stuff, it was our top choice during our trip in Italy (including another hotel in Pisa).	The owner (and her parents) made us feel very welcome.	The rooms (and common areas) are very large and have a personal touch.	They are modern, have decent beds and a good bathroom.	Excellent value for money.
Amazing location, only 5 mins walk to the Tower of Pisa and train station.	Wonderful service with a lovely and caring host &quot;Francesca&quot;.	Very spacious room with clean environment.	Will definitely recommend to my friends with real affordable price.	If I'm back to pisa again will be sure staying here again.	Regards from Ireland.
excellent value for money.	very close to main attractions and on bus route to station and airport.	very clean with lovely staff.	breakfast-fresh croissant, juice and coffee taken in pleasant cafe downstairs.	highly recommended budget hotel.	basic 	but classy
we aririved pisa and got alittle shock from the whole hotles and bb, everything was very croudy and not friendly at all... We were on our way out of this city and then we found this lovely bb.	It has the best location, very cloose (5 min walk) to the leaning tower.	Very nice people, very big rooms, very very clean.	It is highly recomended.
Came here to have lunch with colleagues and it was very nice.	We went to the backyard, menu was good, varied, food presentation was clean, excellent, delicious and prices are average.	Will come back for sure.
After having completely mixed up online booking of hotel in Pisa  for one night before going back to London,  I walked around  and found this nice hotel just 50 meters from the train station after arriving from Florence by train!	It has very spacious room for family of 4 (it even had one more extra bed).	The bathroom 	though was a bit down for the overall experience, not dirty 	but needed a bit shining.The breakfast was very simple, 	but for one night it was OK.The location is just perfect when traveling by train (1min walking around the corner).The taxi stop is at the train station (1 min walking) and the taxi takes about 5 minutes to Galileo Galilei International Airport.Would definitely consider staying there again if traveling through Pisa.Very friendly and helpful staff.
I have found that most hotels in Italy are tiny.	But my husband,  2 children  I were very pleased with the size the room here.	It is almost across the street from the train station were for about 10 euro you can catch a train to Florence (under an hour) You can also spend a euro or two and hop on a bus that will take you all over Pisa.	not only will i recommend the Roseto to my  friends  family, It is were I will be staying whenever In Pisa.
We spent our last night of a 2 week Tuscan trip in Pisa so that we would be close to the train station on arrival and when we wanted to leave early to catch a taxi to the aeroporto for the flight home.	The room itself was OK, 	though they failed to tell us how to turn the lights on in our room (it had the key card in the slot thing) so we had to go back downstairs to find out.	Communication was definitely as issue at this hotel, since the desk clerk spoke just enough English to make us think he understood what we were saying, 	but I don't think so half the time.	The shower was SMALL, and I've seen some small ones in Europe, usually with no complaints.	Pisa itself was disappointing after Florence, Cortona, Siena, Vernazza, and Lucca.	We did get some cool David refrigerator magnets for our girls at the Leaning Tower however.	The biggest problem we had was that 	even though we told the desk clerk at least 3 times that we were leaving at 6:30 am for the airport, we found the front gate locked as we tried to leave the next morning.	I walked back to the apartment where the clerk was pulling on his pants to come out.	He was agitated that we wanted to leave before they open the gates at 7:00 am.	Well, he opened up and we are back home and that is just another story to tell.	Why would you have a hotel next to a train station and near the airport that you can't leave before 7 in the morning?	Beware.
We stayed at the hotel on New Year's Eve as hotels in Florence and Rome were tight.	The location is convenient for those arriving by train, 	but about 20-min walk from the historical centre.	The area around the train station also tends to have more budget eating options that open longer hours, as compared to the town centre.We paid 72 Euro for a basic, tiny room with toilet.	The place is all right, being rather clean with a springy bed and a small tv (with all Italian channels).	Because of the tiny room size we could only walk the narrow path around the bed.The bathroom is very new and the nicest part of the room.	However the floor gets wet easily due to poor shower partition, and the lack of a curb at the entrance means the room also tends to get pretty wet too.The room rate also doesn't come with breakfast, which is charged at 5 Euro per person.	The staffs are also pretty hands-off, meaning they will advise if asked 	but otherwise will not engage guests.	They close the hotel at 1am, 	but will give you the key to the front door if asked.Overall it's all right place to crash for a night, 	but the very bare rooms will not impress.
Very noisy at night.	Beds are very small - I'm 5'6&quot; and my feet were hanging out of the end!	The walls were like paper so you can feel very intimate with your neighbours.	Shower is poor.	Convenient location 	though.	We wouldn't stay again.
â€¢ The staff was extremely helpful and friendl !	â€¢ The rooms were not modern 	but were very clean.	â€¢ The area isn't much pleasant 	but it's great to be so close to the train station (right next to it actually).
Located directly outside Pisa train station, this hotel is very easy to find.	Tourist spots like Leaning Tower are about a 20 minute walk away.	The staff are ok, some friendly, some a bit abrupt.	They expect payment on check-in, cash or card.	The rooms are adequate, the air-conditioning is intermittent and takes time to figure out how to turn it on.	It says free Wifi 	but it never worked for us.	There is NO safe in the room and you have to hand your key to reception every time you leave hotel, so leaving valuables in the room is a risk.	We padlocked everything in our case and put it under the bed.	Room has a fridge 	but buy drinks outside hotel and put them in there yourself.	Bed is reasonably comfy, bit hard and only 3 pillows.	Hotel can get a bit noisy at night, the reception is echoey and the people above us were restless for some reason.	Breakfast was quite good actually.	7:30-10:00: tea and coffee, juice, fresh water, bread, meats, cereals, yoghurts, pastries, even scrambled egg and sausages.	This made a difference.They lock reception after midnight, so make sure you get the code for the side gate if staying out later than that.Check-out 10:30.	Overall it's a hit and miss hotel 	but does the job for the price.
Hotel is very close to Station  bus services.	Rooms are cheap 	but still have air-conditioning  Staff are very friendly.	Breakfast is good.	Overall a wonderful place to stay with easy access to Pisa (via walking or buses) or further afield via trains.	First room we were given had broken shutters that couldn't be used 	but staff moved us within half an hour.Would thoroughly recommend for anyone looking for cheap accommodation with easy access.
Over priced and mis-informed upon arrival.	i.e.	We were under the impression we had booked with parking and breakfast included 	but had not so this resulted in an additional 35 euro per night we were not anticipating.	For $250 cdn per night we are confident there are much more sufficient accommodations.SleepingWe had a family room with 5 x single beds.	The beds were uncomfortable and the area was very noisy.	Street traffic is loud and near reciption or even on the next floor, you hear everything.	The walls are thin.	The positive 	though is that the airconditioning works well which is essential for a stay in Italy in the summer.BreakfastBreakfast is an additional $5 euro per person and must be booked the night before.	We confirmed with multiple staff and still nothing was left and they were not expecting us.	The staff &quot;informed&quot; us that there was an Asian tour group that morning and that &quot;they always eat everything&quot; plus they were not expecting us (family of 4).	Obviously this is not our issue and nor an acceptionable/professional response.	We confirmed with staff that breakfast was served until 9:30am and informed them we would not be attending breakfast until 9am.	Still, there was limited (not enough to feed 1 person) of cold bacon and eggs left.	Apparently they cook one batch at 7:15am and let it sit.	They do not replenish.	If you arrive at 7:15am, breakfast is worth it... any later and it is not unless they change their practices.	StaffStaff are friendly and the male staff in particular goes out of his to assist and speaks very good English.	Location1 minute walk to the train station and 10 minute walk to the tower (with a 5 and 7 year old).	Cleanliness  FunctionalityClean.	The floors could be better swept 	but no concern as for cleanliness.	The shower is warm and offers good water pressure.	Linens we're fresh upon arrival 	but are not changed daily (anticipated with a 2-star hotel).	To maintain electricity, you need to leave a card in the slot by the door.	This does not need to be the card with the key - it can be an Air Miles card.	The toilet barely functions.	You need to hold the button and try 3 times to actually fully flush the toilet.	The fridge did not work.	OverallWe would not book again and would explore other options in the future.	That said, if your options are limited and you are simply looking for a place to crash at night, this is adequate.
we had a very nice experience in this hotel with my family.	a very warm welcome buy the owners and very helpful.	good breakfast for the value paid and served with hot croissants.
I stayed here for one night before catching an early morning flight from Pisa airport.	Location is very convenient to the train station, where you can catch a quick and easy train directly to the airport.	Staff at the front desk wern't particularly friendly, and my room wasn't very clean (the table was sticky and obviously hadn't been wiped down).	Wouldn't want to stay longer than one night - 	but the convenience made it passable.
In august our extended family group(11) spent one night at the hotel roseto before travelling on to barga for a villa holiday.	the hotel was idealy situated close to the railway station for travel to florence, and for restuarants, etc...  the staff were very friendly and helpful.	we had hired cars and the hotel had off street enclosed parking for a small fee which put our minds at rest.	our stay also included buffet breakfast taken in a small dining room or in a sunny courtyard (most enjoyable)  We all enjoyed our stay clean airconditioned rooms and would definately stay there again when in Pisa
This hotel is very well located.	It was very easy for me as a touris to get arround the city thanks to the train station and the bus station.Besides, the price was good, my room was always very neat and the staff Gimmi, Maurizio, Antonella were really nice with me.	They were all the time asking me about my stay here, the were veyr attantive and respectful.
I picked this hotel because it will be convenient for me to take my morning train on the next day to Florence.	The hotel situated very near to the train station.	It is also within walking distance to bus station and local restaurants.	The hotel price is cheap and the room is small 	but good enough for a backpacker like me.
This was my 2nd stay at this hotel (prev.	2010) There has been a drop in their reception staff standards since my earlier visit when I was allocated a ground floor room.	There is no elevator, lift, to the 1st floor rooms, so lugging heavy baggage is difficult for a 70's man.	The stairs and corridor were in darkness until a motion sensor eventually brought the lights on.In October 2015 I was allocated 1st floor room 13, facing a side street.	The room was just ample for a man on his own.	It was serviced every day and the bathroom was always clean with fresh towels.	As a word of warning to travellers, and I hope the hotel management, the polished marble floor in the room 13 bathroom is a great hazard for slips and falls - equally bad is the polished marble floor in the bedroom: This means any wet feet will cause you to slip....and a nasty way to end a holiday far from home (I am in Australia) with broken bones or wrist!	Nothing bad happened to me I am glad to report.The breakfast offered was average in variety, 	but sufficient.Travellers may like to know it is a 25 to 30 minute level walk from the hotel to the Leaning Tower of Pisa complex.
I spend one night in this hotel, solo in a single room closed to the reception desk.first the receptionist was a bit intrusive and called me in my room, asking my number.	he should stay professional and that's enough.then the room is tiny, impossible to breath because with a strange humid smell.	the AC didn't work.	the internet is poor, only for one device and you need to re-log every 10 min â€¦ !!	!this night, it started to rain and then impossible to closed an eye!	such a noise on the room that i tough the water would came in.	I looked for someone at the desk and there was nobody, the door for outside were looked !	this is totally crasy.	the worst hotel in my life, nightmare!
I stayed in this hotel for one night for a weekend trip to Pisa.	I was traveling alone and I would not recommend this hotel to any woman traveling alone.	During the check-in the (male) receptionist asked me very inappropriate questions such as if I am married, if I like to go dancing and to drink beer and in the end also if I liked violent men which I found very disturbing.	Needless to say, I was terrified and did not sleep very well that night.	Apart from being disrespected by the receptionist, the window did not open, there where holes in the sheets and it was very noisy at night.	In addition the Wi-Fi did not work.Don't sleep here unless you really have to.
The location of the hotel is excellent as it is located directly opposite Pisa's central train station.However,I found the staff were particularly unhelpful and rather ponderous.In addition,the breakfast provided was bland and very basic.I would definitely not stay there again.
This hotel is a budget option.	It is next to the train station and within walking distance to the Leaning Tower.	The room was very clean.	AC worked well.	The beds were comfortable.	The staff was nice and helpful.	It isn't cute or pretty 	though, and doesn't have any atmosphere at all.	Parking is in a locked lot next door for $15/day.	They also rent bikes in the lot.	Breakfast is extra 	but we didn't eat there.	There are several little bake
The location is just next to train station, also pisa is not very big city so you can walk to the monuments if you feel like.The room was nice and comfortable.The breakfast was not so fresh could be improved.
We booked one night on a overnight stay in Pisa, the only hotel available on net.What a find, opposite the station, close to everything, the staff were excellent, good Italian breakfast included in the price.	The room was not very big, 	but had private bathroom.	Very clean, not dust found anywhere.	WILL stay here again.The only down fall is that being so close to the station is that there are always some dodgy characters hanging around the station area.	BUt you find that in every city....
The Hotel is very convenient for the independent traveller, Pisa airport connects directly to the City (about 10 minutes on the train) and the train station  is just two minutes walk from the Hotel.The area round the train station is at best a bit scruffy, and the hotel fits in well!However the rooms are adeqaute, they offer a quad room which is great for families, and the breakfast, 	although not 5* is sufficient to fill you up before the day.	I never did crack the coffee machine, whatever you select you get the same drink.The main sights are a half hour walk away, 	but a walk that is interesting and tasteful, the nearer the tower you get the more expensive everything is - 	but that is no great shock.
No elevator, we did not get any help to carry our heavy bags upstairs.	We did not get advice from the reception of how to use the lights in the room and we asked the cleaner who was helpful.	The staff at the reception did not smile or talk much.	The lady 	though gave us advise how to go the tourist information center and recommended a bus than a train to go to Viareggio because of a train accident.The breakfast was okey with also cheese and ham.	There was a TV in the breakfast room.The colours in the hotel were terrible orange, green..	The room was small.	There was no noise of traffic to our room, so we could sleep quite well.	The bathroom was terrible.	When it got wet, the smell was awful...	There is mould.Location is close to railway station.	There is an afro-asian shop in the same street 	but also an elegant wine shop.	I do not know if the area is safe late at night.	It was easy to reach the hotel when we came from Florence by train.	We also took a train to the Pisa airport when leaving.	There were only three passengers in the morning.	We did not see any taxis at the taxi station.We walked to the Pisa tower, 	but there are also buses.	In tourist information they guided us a nice way to walk there.	There is not a long way to a shopping street from the hotel and there were also some restaurants some steps away.From a bus station we bought tickets to Viareggio beach resort.	The bus stop was not far from our hotel.	The buses were full of beach vendors when we came back and the bus was very hot.	So, do not wait until the last bus.	Luckily the driver opened the door while driving.
In a very convenient location close to the train station and approximately a 20 minute walk to the leaning tower.	Our room had been recently renovated and was clean and very quiet (with the exception of our neighbors).	The breakfast was plentiful and the staff were very helpful.	I would recommend this hotel for those staying 1 or 2 nights in Pisa.
Lovely room, plenty of drawers and hanging space, our breakfast was included, nothi flash 	but adequate, and the staff were very friendly and helpful.	We loved our room,the shower was small, so not good for larger persons!	!This hotel has no lifts, so stairs could be a problem for some.	Right next to the main station, great location, we walked everywhere from here quite easily, then train to Airport Leave lots of time to catch train, 	although only one stop to airport, took us nearly an hour to get the train, cancellations, change of platform two minutes before scheduled departure, then of course big delay as everyone exchanged trains!
Stayed here for 3 nights for a surprise weekend away.	My husband booked this hotel as it was close to the train station and was a reasonable price.	When we arrived he siad the pictures were mis-leading, and having seen photos myself now on bookings.com I would agree - our room and bathroom were alot smaller then the pictures suggest.	Having said that, it was perfectly fine for the price.	Very close to the station 	but wasn't disturbed from any outside noise at all.	Most of the noise (which was minimal) came from the staff setting out breakfast in the morning.	The room was basic and small, 	but clean, Breakfast was a bit disappointing.	The first morning they had run out of bread.	Tea, coffee and fruit juice are provided with a selection or strange pastries.	No croissants or bread rolls with meat and cheese as you would expect on the continent.	Fruit was apples and oranges - maybe we weren't at the right time of year for the lovely fresh fruit other people have mentioned!	I would recommend this for a budget traveller if you want somewhere cheap and convenient for a few nights.	All the sights in Pisa are within half an hours walk.
I spent a night in Hotel Rosetto, October 16/17, 2012.	I had room 13, a real single, very small 	but not suffocating.	Room was acceptable and the hotel was half-way between the train and the bus station, very convenient for me since I reached Pisa in the evening by plane and then train and leaved early next morning by bus.	The persons at the reception (both in the evening and in the morning were kind enough to help carrying my suitcase on the stairs (no elevator).	All in all, I have no complains about the room except the fact that I thought that it was too expensive at 55 eur/night, at the end of the tourist season.
This hotel is 2 minutes from Pisa Central (out the front of station and diagonal left), in the perfect position for arriving by train and flying out.The staff were delightful, friendly and very helpful.	Rooms were large, clean and quiet.	Would definitely stay there again and very happy to recommend.	So perfect.	Just one grumble, I would have liked a blanket in the room as an extra (I feel the cold).	Thank you to the young man who made the breakfasts, we really appreciated your help in getting us on our way early.Maureen and Richard Australia
This was a five minute walk from the train station so it was very convenient for us as we were leaving the next day for Bologna.	We only stayed one night 	but had no problems with the hotel.	The front desk staff was courteous and spoke English.	The room was smallish 	but all of the rooms that we stayed in were as well and clean.	Everything functioned just fine in the room, and there was absolutely no noise from the train station.	We had a small balcony and could let some air in the room, we couldn't figure out the air conditioning 	but it didn't matter as the night was nicely cool.	All in all a very good value for the money especially if you want to be able to get to the train station quickly.
We had a double room for my parents and a single room for me.	The single was a little small 	but perfectly cosy and just what I needed!	The double was very spacious, with a balcony a nice bathroom.	Showers not baths 	but for that time of year it wasn't a problem.	Staff were very friendly 	though they didn't speak english.	We spoke some Italian and they were very good about it.	The hotel is close to the station and airport 	but equally not far from all the sites.
I had lost the business card for this lovely little hotel and finally found the info again to write this review 	but the people at this hotel saved my group and I from what could have been a very interesting night.	We are all college students who had been traveling for a month around Europe and we had one flight (RyanAir, so random airports) that got us into Pisa at 12am.	We were then planning to leave the next morning to Florence so figuring we could stay in the airport we didn&#39;t book any hostel or hotel for the night.	We were a group of two girls and four guys, so a decent sized group so when we were told the airport was closing we were a little lost as to what to do.	We then decided to walk to the train station with our big backpacking bags and try to stay the night there.	When we got there, we came to encounter may very sketchy looking people and were pretty sure if we went to sleep we would get robbed.	Really lost at this point we decided to lug our bags around and see if we could find a place to stay (1:30am at this point).	We checked many hotels for both rooms and just places to keep our bags and not one place was willing to help us out until we got here.

Not only did they try to find a room for us 	even though they were fully booked 	but they let us store our luggage for FREE.	They let us use their lobby bathroom to change and treated us like we were family in a way.	Being able to drop our bags we decided why not to just stay up and explore the city.	We ended up finding a 24 hour coffee shop where I guess the street kids hang out (pretty funny scene) that changes their coffee price from 2 euros to 7,50 euros between 1am and 7am 	but we wondered over and saw one of the most incredible things I have ever seen.	We saw the Leaning Tower of Pisa at 5am with just us.	It was beautiful.	A tourist trap location with no one around.	Without the lovely hospitality we experienced at this hotel, I would have a very different view of Pisa today.	It also had a great location and yummy breakfast for I think only 8 euros without a room purchase.	I don't know what the rooms are like 	but I do know that the staff would do ANYTHING within their power to make your stay the best it could possibly be.	I would highly recommend staying here.</span><span class=taLnk ulBlueLinks moreBtn onclick=widgetEvCall('handlers.clickExpand', event, this);>More</span>
Stayed at Hotel Roseto whilst in Pisa , i recommend it and will stay again.	The rooms were spotless and big, must have been refurbished recently.	Had air con, which was a relief as the weather had been so hot, the breakfast abundant, with a range of food from fresh fruit to a home made cake.	The location is fantastic as its just across the road from the station  and not far from the city centre.	All the staff were lovely and  the owner was fantastic, so friendly , kind and helpful, felt like i was at home.	Great work Hotel Roseto !	Grazie !
Perfectly pleasant hotel near the train station.	The room was a decent size for 4 people.	The area around the hotel was pretty typical for being close to the train station.	We came back to our room about 10:30 and passed 2 vagrants.	Across from our hotel was a liquor store where a group of young men drinking bottles of booze out of paper bags had congregated.	We crossed the street to avoid any trouble.	The hotel staff was friendly and helpful.	Breakfast was dissapointing.	The croissants were dry and stale.	The pan of scrambled eggs were burnt.	The price was on the lower end of the various hotels I looked at.	Next time I might look for something with a bit more ambience in a different part of town depending upon the price.
The room - clean, massive TV, ensuite bathroom.Location - Quite easy to access main sites, 	but far enough from center to be accessible by car without too much stress.	Sat Nav recommended.	Best Bit - Cheap and ChearfulNot so good - coffee, breakfast.Summary - serves it purpose.	Probably wouldn't want to stay there for very long.
We arrived very late to Pisa Central Train Sta.	and were immediately concerned with the safety of the area around the station.	The hotel is a stones'-throw from the station and we never really felt good about our choice (booked online).	The room was plenty large enough for us and we toughed-out the night.	We changed hotels the second night and were much happier.	You get what you pay for, and at the Roseto that means thin walls, stained bedspread (with a patch sewn in for good measure), a strange odor and really odd towels.	I must admit that the hotel and area looked much better in daylight, 	but it just wasn't for us.
Great location also and staff very friendly.	We only stayed two nights 	but found it very accessible and all we required for a short stopover.	Clean and roomy we didn't take meals here so can't comment.	The hotel us situated right across from the railway station and taxi rank also.	As there was upgrade work being carried out we found it noisy 	though.
Lovely little BB, beautifully 	but simply decorated with understated elegance and charm.	Down a rather shabby little side street 	but very close to the station and nice and quiet.	The place was spotless and comfortable, with lots of little extra touches that made us feel at home.	Romeo, the host / owner was very friendly and helpful, recommended an excellent little local restaurant just down the road and made us feel welcome and relaxed.	I'd stay there again if I return to Pisa.
Great location, near to everything, the owner is extremely helpful and the rooms are really clean.	They don't look like guest rooms, you have the feeling of sleeping at a friend's house.	Toilets (2) in common 	but well equipped.	Breakfast: croissants, joghurt coffee, cappuccino.	Not an hotel 	but compaired to other places nearby it is one of the best options.	Easy to find a parking nearby.	Not noisy, you can sleep good (Pisa has many universities, so sometimes it is really noisy).
We had a long stay between flights so we booked a night here.	It was lovely, clean, good location and the owners were most helpful and friendly!	The place was very clean, the shared bathroom was only called shared 	but was used by our party only.	We had a great night sleep, it was very quiet.	Will recommend to friends and family!
We stay there for 2 nights,1 day.	The personal was friendly.	The room ( double bed room standard ) was small.	Good bathroom.	Price of the minibar was very high.	Parking place cost 20 euro for 1 night.
Would definitely visit again.	Very impressed with the whole experience of staying in Italy.	Exceptionally helpful staff, well recommend a trip to Florence.	We travelled return to Florence for just under 35â‚¬, clean trains, train station was directly opposite the hotel.	Leaning tower was an easy walk from the hotel approx.	A 20 minute stroll.	Lots of fab eateries, bars, gelato shops and shopping.......shopping with mega sales....oh and shopping.	NH Pisa was brilliant and we will be returning with friends and family in tow.	Recommend a Ponce from the bar at the square by the river on the way to the learning tower.	Also recommend the ice cream at the gelato shop next to the bar.	Investigate the roads off of the high street stretch also as there are some lovely restaurants and bars all around.	We found a lovely restaurant on Valentine's night that we hadn't booked who were very accommodating.	Our meal .. seafood spaghetti and steak (800g t bone) was exceptional with a huge range of wine on the wine list.	The whole meal came to just under 70â‚¬ it was amazing so much so that we returned to eat another meal two evenings later.	A fab little break away, we didn't want to come home and will be returning again.	Very soon!
We stayed for 1 night only.	Room was clean.	Buffet breakfast was good.	Lots of option for cold  hot food.	The location is the best, airport  Pisa tower can be reached by foot.There are lots of food shops in this area,
It is 1 min walk from the hotel to the train station, breakfast is exceptionally good, freshly baked pastries, very tasty and delicious!	Helpful staff.	Room is comfortable.	Highly recommended to visitors to Pisa.
The location is really good and the hotels environment is really clean and nice, and the people there are very warm and nice.	The only disadvantage is that the facilities in the bathroom is a little bit old and broken.
Well situated hotel right opposite  main railway station with regular trains to Florence and Lucca,both of which we visited and thoroughly enjoyed.Bus from and to Airport,10 minutes if that away,stopped right outside the hotel both ways.Arrived well before check in time 	but in room within minutes.Very friendly and helpful staff at reception.Room very satisfactory(312) with good bath/shower,fridge,TV and free wifi throughout hotel.Basic buffet breakfast 	but reasonable choices except not much in the way of hot food 	but enough for us to enjoy.No other dining options 	but not far to go to find some reasonable eating places in the evening.We walked slowly to the obvious attractions passing shops on the way and arrived within 30 minutes or less.So would be happy to recommend here and would definitely use again if we go back to Pisa
We stayed here for two nights and I would highly recommend!	The overall location of the hotel is perfect.	The Leaning Tower of Pisa is a quick walk, you are literally across from the Pisa Centrale Station, and the taxi and bus service is right out front.	We were nervous about finding the hotel from Pisa Airport 	but we were delighted to find out the Taxi service had a fixed rate of 9 Euros to the hotel.	The hotel was very clean and well maintained.	There were no interruptions in service from the moment we arrived to the moment we checked out!
A little quirky finding it, 	but a good experience for sisghtseeing.	There were over 20 of us checking in for an overnight stay.	The check in process was rather smooth, 	but the elevators could only handle three people and luggage at at time.	Kinda frustrating after a day's travel getting there.	The room was small and practical.	The breakfast provided something for everyone from he buffet to fresh cooked items.
Stayed a night at this hotel a week ago, flew from Gatwick, for  a week in Italy, this Hotel is in a very good location, right opposite to Pisa train station, city shopping centre is just 5 minutes by walk, bus stop at the Hotel takes you to the famous Pisa leaning Tower.	This hotel offers free WIFI;  Next day took a train to Florence for two nights.	read my review for Hotel C-Hotels Diplomat for more Info.
I recently stayed a night at this NH hotel.	The location is perfect if you have an early flight, train, or simply plan to spend a few days in this wonderful city.	I was initially assigned a room in the 2nd floor that was not renovated.	The carpets were stained and the walls were not in the condition that one would expect for a hotel of this category.	After a quick call to the front desk I was reassigned to a room in the same floor 	but in the opposite wing.	Floor were all wood, bathroom floors, counter tops were in marble, and the decor was pristine.	Customer service was top notch.	Breakfast was included 	but since I had an early train I was not able to enjoy it.The hotel is a quick 15 minute walk to the tower, there are restaurants, cafes, a gym, and a supermarkets nearby.	Because of its closeness  to the train station, there are characters roaming around 	but I would NOT characterize the area as unsafe.	I definitively enjoyed my stay in Pisa.
The nh Hotel in Pisa has the friendliest staff you could ever come across in a hotel.	Always smiling.	Always friendly.Always helpful.	From the room maid to the kitchen to the front desk.	Wonderful!	And being located straight across from the train station and 10 minutes from the airport makes for a good base to visit Tuscany.	No noise from outside was very surprising.	Wish it had a bar.
Nice hotel, right opposite the rail station in central Pisa.	Its a lovely 30 minute walk to the tower through picturesque Italian Streets.	Friendly, helpful staff who spoke good English.	Nice, well appointed rooms with comfortable bed.
This comfortable hotel is situated about 100m from Pisa Centrali rail station.	Pisa is a rail hub where you can easily travel to Livorno, Lucca, Florence, Cinque Terra and Rio Maggiori.	A great way to see the local sights.PROSVery convenient to Pisa rain station.	Clean, comfortable, very good buffet breakfast and good internet.	English speaking front desk.	Off-site parking is around the corner 	but expensive.	We were able to walk to all the sightseeing locations.CONSAs usual with a railway station location the general surroundings could be better.	Having said that, the area is not unsafe.	We think the location to the station trumps the surroundings.
Hotel was excellent with a fantastic location very close to railway station buses and taxis... cleanliness was impressive the only drawback was no restaurant in the evening...it was my second stay there and would not hesitate to go back!
Stayed here just for one night to ease our return to UK to avoid a very early start from Florence.	We couldn't believe the value we got having booked through expedia - Â£75 per couple including breakfast!	It's 5-10 mins by taxi to the airport which could also be walked in 15 minutes.	The hotel must have been recently refurbished in modern and contemporary style with large open public areas.	The rooms are not especially large 	but are designed well and very comfortable and include tea/coffee making facility and ours had a small balcony overlooking the piazza in front of the main Pisa train station.	Despite it's central location there was no obvious noise.	The staff were brilliant from arrival and a special mention for Nicola (a guy on reception) who was just brilliant who also pointed us in the direction of a great restaurant 2mins from the hotel - Lo Schiaccianoci.	The hotel is not set in the tourist area 	but it is only a pleasant 15 minute walk to the main tourist interests.	We don't think you can go wrong booking this hotel at the price we did - great value.
I didn't arrive by train 	but for anyone traveling by train to Pisa this is the ideal choice.	Across the Street...	It's also withing walking distance to the heart of Pisa and the Leaning Tower.	I arrived late and still had time to walk around and do some sight seeing.	The Room was incredible and to wifi was very good too.
A comfortable modern hotel well located for travellers and visitors.	Two minutes walk from station, about 8-10 to the edge of the old town, and 15-20 minutes to the Duomo, Tower and Campo Santo.	The building and interior are functional, clean and well maintained.	We had a room on the 4th floor overlooking the busy station 	but with effective triple glazed windows we could hear no external noise.	Room was compact 	but not cramped, with some stylish attention to detail in the placing of lights, mirrors etc.	Bathroom had both shower and tub.	Breakfast was fine.	We got friendly and helpful service from the staff at check in and check out.	If you set your expectations realistically (i.e.	are not looking for luxury or period character 	but want something significantly better than basic budget accommodation) then this fits the bill.	We thought it was reasonable value and would stay there again.
Lovely town.	Very friendly and relaxing.	Easy to travel to Pisa and much cheapier than for example Firenze and Rome.	The area around the leaning tower and churches and tombs were fantastic, so clean and not that crowdy as i thought before.
Excellent hotel, perfectly situated for our needs, being opposite the main line station, and was in walking distance of a variety of good eateries.	Fabulous staff, friendly, helpful, polite.	Our room was absolutely amazing!!!	lovely view.	Free Wi-Fi.	I would like to say a special thanks to the reception staff who were brilliant a special thanks to Enrico who is best receptionist .Recommend this hotel 100% and would love to return again.
Excellent place, amazing spot unique service , just next to the train station and really near everything,clean place and great price,Pisa tower and all the hot spot places are very close you will be very satisfied as we were...
On our way back from Florence we decided to stay a night and pick up a flight next day, this hotel was perfect.	It is located opposite Pisa Centrale station so not far to lug the cases, it is quite modern internally with modern finishes etc.	The room was equipped with a king size bed and TV, the on suite has a bi fold screen to flush floor mounted shower, a colosses of a wash hand basin with the toilet of a height that you felt like a small child as your feet did not touch the floor.	We could not find fault with the room which overlooked the station frontage from the first floor.Breakfast was traditional continental or as we had fresh fruit, cereal and toast, coffee was machine ground coffe and quite palitable.The main moan is again the City tax of 2 euro each per night, what did I get for this was a question no one answered.
Name of the hotel is actually NH Cavalieri, not NH Pisa.	Anyway, the hotel is a good NH hotel and was improved a few years ago.	Now all rooms have good aircondition and are modern.	Some of the rooms are very small, 	but other than that a good hotel.	Typical NH breakfast which is good and better than many other smaller italian hotels.	Stayed at the hotel 6-8 times on business and i always use this hotel when i am in Pisa.	Hotel is located in downtown and there is like 20 min walk to the tower.	Located 100 meter from the railway station in Pisa.
This hotel looks a very good quality building however the checkin was awful as it took a long time with someone who could not speak English which is weird as they consider the hotel to be of international standard and I wanted to ask questions 	but could not.We chose the hotel as we wanted to eat dinner there -- I have cut and pasted the following from their website&quot;The Ristorante dei Cavalieri is an excellent spot to sample some of Tuscanyâ€™s tastiest dishes.&quot;Ooohhh to have had the chance 	but the restaurant remained stubbornly closed.We had an upmarket room and had a tea/coffee tray 	but they did not supply milk.The breakfasts were nice and as we travelled by train the location opposite was great.	-- It seemed all buses including the hop-on hop-off tour bus also stopped outside so it was in an excellent location 	but we did however struggle to locate restaurants in an easy walking distance as all we could find was just one which was quite expensive.
Wonderful location for busses, trains, local shops and restaurants.Modern, spotlessly clean rooms with excellent beds and pillows.	While in a busy area there is very effective sound proofing with no traffic noise to disturb.Did not have breakfast as we preferred to stroll to a local cafe so while we can not speak for the food we can say that the dining area looked bright and inviting.
We only stayed here for one night because our flight left from Pisa, 	but we had a very pleasant experience.	The staff (Nicola who welcomed us at the reception in particular) was very kind and helpful.	Our room was ready before the agreed time.	I liked that a 2 person room has 2 single beds on wheels which can be put together or separate.	Bathroom and breakfast were excellent.	The only downside was that the rooms are not soundproof.	I don't mind hearing muffled conversations at all, 	but it got annoying when I could here my 'neigbour' snore.	Other than that everything was awesome.
Excellent location opposite station and around the corner to the main street.	Very good clean and modern hotel with good hot and cold breakfast.	Ask for renovated rooms or complimentary upgrade.	They will try to help.	Well appointed rooms, good wifi and parking.	Minor considerations were it didn't have its own restaurant for dinner 	but they recommended a very good one 5 minutes away.	Could do with more coffee in the room.	Staff very helpful and we had an excellent stay.	Would definitely stay here again.
The room was very clean and the bed comfortable.	If you are in a single room, it may could be small for you - 	but it's large enough to sleep.	The hotel is just opposite the main station and within 30 minutes walking distance from all major attractions.	The breakfast was very delicious with rice milk, regular milk, fresh fruits, eggs, and much more.
The NH Pisa is a modern hotel located directly across the road from Pisa Centrale Railway Station, so is ideally situated for day trips by train 	though the down side to this is that it is a fair 20-30 minute walk to Pisa's main attraction, the Leaning Tower, Duomo and Baptistry.	Despite its location, there is good sound proofing and there was little or no disturbance from traffic, either on the road outside or from the nearby railway.For our week long stay, we had an upgraded room with balcony on the fifth floor and the room itself was well presented and clean 	though the fact that it has a balcony means that it is smaller than comparable rooms on the floors below.	Some may find it a bit cramped 	but was more than adequate for our needs.There is a breakfast room on the ground floor which was big enough for most guests to be accomodated.	Only on one occasion did be have to wait a few minutes while staff cleared tables.Breakfast itself was the usual self-service continental style with a small hot selection (scrambled eggs and bacon) and a good selection of breads, cheese, meats, yoghurts and fruit which was regularly replenished.Front desk staff were pleasant and efficient during both the check-in and check-out process whilst staff in the Breakfast Room were also pleasant and friendly.The only downside was that the air con in our room produced a musty smell.	However, with the balcony, it was possible to open the doors wide to allow air to circulate and we don't normally sleep with the air con on in any case, so this was not an issue for us.We would have no hesitation in staying at the NH Pisa on our next visit to the city, nor indeed recommending it to visitors.
Modern, spotlessly clean and excellent location opposite Pisa central station.	The room was very nice with a good powerful shower.	The staff were very friendly and helpful.	Nice breakfast with a good choice.
Picked this hotel for location opposite Pisa Centrale station so great base for train journeys to Florence, Lucca, La Spezia.	Modern hotel, nice big room, very quiet 	even though facing station (rm 407) due to secondary glazing so slept well.	Very comfy beds, good hot shower.	Plenty to eat in buffet breakfast , 	though sometimes queue for coffee machine.	Friendly staff.	Only issue we encountered was no chest of drawers to put our clothes in.	2 small drawers in wardrobe of which one side blocked by large desk so we had to keep our clothes in cases.	Room must have been designed for a man for a male staying one night!	Please sort for future guests!	Despite this, I would definitely stay again.
Stayed there for one night and this is not our first visit so we were very disappointed when we received a sub standard room (104) this room had obviously not been renovated - 	though the hotel advertises safes in every room there was none in this room and the rooms you see on the web are not like this.	Very old TV - air con unit falling to bits, carpet and deco shabby, bathroom needing up graded.. there was dust under the mini bar  in the room looks like not been touched for ages.. We have stayed here before and had the renovated rooms which are really lovely and did not realise that some rooms still required to be upgraded so would think twice about staying again.	Just a shame.. there is also no bar area in the hotel where you can have a drink before going out for dinner or on your return..
This Hotel is opposite Pisa Central rail station and a 10 minute stroll to the popular leaning tower.	Our room was slightly worse for wear with flaking plaster 	but we were well rested in the comfy bed with full air conditioning.	Wi-fi connection was disappointing as the signal was week, hotel claimed to provide 256kbs and we could only get 68kbs (free for the first 24 hours).	Breakfast had a good selection of pastries, cereals, and hot food with good coffee.	I would recommend this hotel if you don't rely on the Internet.
A very pleasant stay.	The only negative is that it is so near the railway and bus station that seems to encourage many street sellers onto the pavement outside the hotel and along the street beside the hotel going to the city.	The hotel, itself is newly renovated and the rooms are crisp and clean.	Even though we had a room overlooking the busy station plaza it was very quiet due to the triple glazed window system.	The staff were helpful and the included breakfast adequate.
An easy place to stay for a night in Pisa.	If, like us, you arrive at Pisa via the Central Train Station (which serves the airport and Florence), this is a good choice for a comfortable night's stay.	It's directly opposite the station, 10 mins walk to town centre and 20 mins to the Leaning Tower.	Breakfast was decent and overall a reasonable value hotel.	Don't expect luxury however: no in-room tea/coffee (just a free machine with plastic cups in lobby), the &quot;double&quot; room was really a twin, checkout slow and not many amenities.
Just across the street from the railway station, it could not be located better.	The walk to the leaning tower is about 20 min and there are several little restaurants less than 5 min away.While comfortable the room was a bit small, 	but sufficient.	Great breakfast.
My sister and I arrived in Pisa train station tired and weary after a rather long train journey from Venice en route to Cinque Terra.	What a relief as we emerged from the station to see our hotel directly across from us like a welcoming friend.	We requested a twin room 	but were allocated a beautiful family room overlooking the square.	The room was  quiet due to the very effective double glazing.	We loved everything about this hotel, the staff, the room and particularly the delicious healthy breakfast.	The very helpful lady on reception recommended a really lovely restaurant close by for dinner the night we arrived.	Unfortunately we only had one day to explore this lovely city 	but I plan to return again soon.	Hopefully next time I can fit in a spot of shopping as the shops looked very inviting as we passed on our way to The Leaning Tower.
Location is perfect for airport and railway station and it is a pleasant 20 minute walk to campo miracle.	But this side of town is nice too.	I was just a bit disappointed because of a few issues.	Firstly the rooms are pretty small 	although they are nice and modern and the bathroom is good.	Secondly, they only left one towel in the room.	I hate this practice.	Maybe they do get a lot of business customers who only need one towel 	but why should couples on holiday have to go to the trouble of phoning housekeeping and then being kept waiting for over 20 minutes to receive one more towel???	We still only ended up with 2 large and 1 small.	And thirdly, another pet hate - no milk to go with the teas and coffees in the room.	There is no point providing half the kit for a cup of tea!	I had to go down to reception and use a coffee machine to get some milk.	These are all small issues 	but when you are paying Â£112 a night you shouldn't have these little niggles.
Don't get a standard room here, get a superior room.	The rooms here are drastically different, the newer superior room was quite nice, newly remodeled with a huge rainfall shower.	The standard rooms on the other hand simply don't cut it, old and tired.	Breakfast was decent and wifi free.
We stayed here for 3 nights very clean ,great location right by the main station where we took the train to Florence and Lucca  very easy to use and cheap and all on time too, Hotel is only about 15 mins walk from Tower etc  with lots of shops to look at on the way .We took a Taxi from airport for 10 euros  	but you can take the train or bus too ..Overall great trip if or went we went back we would stay here again .
We stayed here for one night whilst on our way to Florence.	The location is superb right outside the train station, a large multi story car park a few minutes walk away and a half an hour walk to the leaning tour.	The room was clean, nice big bed, my boyfriend enjoyed the huge waterfall shower whilst I liked the big bath tub.	Breakfast was great, plenty of choice hot and cold buffet, gluten free bread was available.
Hotel was brilliantly situated for the train station which made travel to Lucca, Siena and Florence all very easy.	When we arrived, it was after midnight and the first room we were allocated on the 5th floor was very unappealing - stank of smoke and was very dated.	As we were using the hotel as a base for 5 nights, we asked to be moved and the room on the 3rd floor was worlds apart - very clean, modern and most importantly, no smell of stale cigarettes.	Breakfast was standard.	The room had a safe, a fridge and very crisp clean bed linen / towels and basic toiletries were provided.	The only real improvements needed are 1) long life milk in the room to make coffee / tea and 2) reception staff to acknowledge you - 	although we attempted to make eye contact and greet them each morning etc, only one lady made any acknowledgement in return.	In general, staff turned away unless checking in a guest and this was noted by others in their reviews.	Did it impact our stay?	Not really, 	but it did create a bizarre atmosphere where we didn't like to approach the staff for advice on trains, restaurants etc which we would normally do to seek local recommendations.
This hotel has a god location since it is near the train station.	You just cross the street.	If you have to change trains, it is very convenient.	The people at the reception a re very nice and helpful.	The breakfast was good too, quite varied.	From the hotel you walk straight down the main road and you are at the Pisa tower.	It is a 30 minutes walk more or less, quite easy to reach.sometimes the people living in the hotel can be loud and the insulation is not 100%.The hotel was a bit overpriced.
If you are flying into Pisa, you can purchase Pisa Mover bus tickets â‚¬1.60 at the airport and travel by bus to the train station.	If you purchase the tickets on the bus they are â‚¬2.	From the bus walk through the train station via the underpass and the hotel is directly opposite.	This was an average convenient hotel suitable for further travel - Florence is 1 hour away and â‚¬16 euros return The hotel reception staff were helpful, 	but facilities are basic.	There are simple foods available in the lobby to purchase ie tea, coffee sandwiches, 	but there are plenty of local bistros which are much better value.	The room had no tea coffee making facilities - so you need to have something - juice/water with you.	The room was clean, it would have been helpful to have a printed list of the tv channels, and you need to check the air con...it switches itself off, and the wifi is temperamental Breakfast was a mixture of cereals, pastries, eggs/bacon/cheese/ ham and fruits The hotel is an easy stroll from the tower
Due to a train strike our travel plans were derailed and we needed to find a hotel in Pisa at short notice, for an overnight stay prior to flying from Pisa airport the next day.	Booked this hotel primarily for its location (opposite train station so v close to airport shuttle bus).	Good quality, particularly the recption area which looked quite classy and recently done up.	R oom was standard 4 star type, with excellent shower.	Given location, was concerned there might be traffic noise, 	but spent a very peaceful night.	Town centre for shopping is a short stroll, with the Tower etc a fair bit further, 	but a pleasant walk nontheless.	Would stay here again.
This hotel was fabulous, it is modern with a contemporary twist, clean and very comfortable.	Our room was a double superior, the beds were very comfy with beautiful comfy pillows, a mini bar, tea and coffee making facilities.	A fabulous shower over the bath, couldn't fault this hotel at all.	Breakfast was a very good selection of cereals, yogurts, fruit, ham, cheeses, eggs, bacon, pastries.	Our room overlooked the Central station which is ideal if you want to travel to different areas.	20 mins to Lucca and 1 hour to Florence.	A 20 - 30 minute walk takes you to the famous Leaning Tower which is fabulous!	Lots of bars and restaurants close to the hotel and beautiful shops.	Stayed here with a friend for her 60 th birthday.	Really good value, stayed 3 nights.
My wife and I with friends enjoyed our one night stay and highly recommend the NH Pisa.	Good location opposite the railway station and within walking distance of the major sights and restaurants.	The rooms are comfortable, very clean, nicely furnished and spacious.	A wonderful and substantial breakfast buffet is included.	We would certainly stay there again.
Best for location: 10 mins on shuttle from airport, right opposite main train station and 15 mins walk into main square.	Reception staff are friendly and the hotel is generally clean.	The room was fairly small - similar size to an IBIS budget Synthetic breakfast a bit worse than that we got on the plane.
We arrived for a one night stay on 13 July.	Entered through the front door, two people at reception.	This is our first impression of this hotel,  Went to reception desk and waited.	And waited.	The two people were looking at a PC screen until finally they realised some guests had arrived.	One was a female trainee and the other person, a man, who we assume was fully trained.	We produced our reservation document which was looked at as if it was a foreign document 	but finally we were checked in to room 412.	We also had a motorway toll ticket which we received when the machine did not accept our euro note.	It was all in Italian so we asked for their help regarding payment.	They handed it back to us, no help at all.	So a trainee working with somebody with zero customer service,  a good start to her career.Went up to room 412.	A nice clean room, air con was quiet and the bed was comfortable.	No complaints about the room 	although wifi was weak.Breakfast was good, usual buffet offering 	but we enjoyed it.	Checkout on the 14th professionally handled.All in all a good stay ruined by poor reception staff on the day.
Great hotel location opposite Pisa Central station, you can get the shuttle (Pisa Mover) from Pisa Airport for â‚¬3 and 10 minutes  later your are at your hotel.It is within a few minutes from bars and restaurants and a 20-25 minute stroll to the leaning tower.Hotel is nice breakfast is good, rooms as usual for Italy are quite small 	but clean and has everything you need, the only shame is there is no bar at the hotel 	but you are only a few steps from several outside bars so not a major concern.Great base to tour Tuscany, it is 1 minute to train station with trains to all destinations, we went to Lucca only 30 minutes very cheap fare it was I think only â‚¬7 euro's return.One last point the hotel staff are great, really helpful and always friendly.	Recommend this hotel, not 5 star 	but really good!
We Stayed at this hotel for a week.	The first impression was good, 	but honestly this place do not look like a 4-star hotel.	Its a nice hotel 	but it realy needs an renovation/refurnish.	You can observe this almost everywere inside.	The breakfast was OK, 	but very booring.	As I mentioned, we were there for a week and EVERY morning it was the same food.	Nothing new or some variations.	Very good beds to sleep on and great wifi.	The aircondition is good 	but very noisy, and sometimes it smells bad from the bathroom.I recommand this hotel if you want to stay in Pisa just for one or two nights.	OR if you want to stay in Pisa 	but travel to other places.	The advantage of this hotel is that it is located 1 min from the Train Station and not so far away from the airport.	We traveled to Carrara, Firenze and Lucca(I realy recommand to see this small city) several times and it was very okei to have the station so near the hotel(btw, you can buy the tickets very easy at the red ticketmaskins in the station.	Card or cash.	BE AWARE OF PICKPOCKETS).	If you want to go to the beach on Tirrania or Marina di Pisa(beautiful places), you can take the bus nr10 from the bus-station 10 min away from the hotel(ask the staff where the corect bus-station is, they will show you on the map.	You buy tickets from the ticketmaskins.	Not in the line).	It takes approx 20-25 min to walk to the Tower.	A nice walk.	The best lunch-restaurant near the hotel is La bottega del Parco 3min away, and another great lunch-place is I Porci Comodi(this one doesnt have tables outside).The best Indian food is at Namaste India Ristorante.	The best dinner you get is at II Bistrot.	Take a break and enjoy a drink at Ristoro Amaltea(waiter Ricardo is the best!).	Use google maps to find these places or ask for the city map from the staff at the hotel.	The staff at this hotel is realy friendly and helpful.	Thank you sweet Laura!	Give this hotel a change if you have a short stay.
A welcome sight to find your hotel right across the street after a long train ride and jet lag.	Conveniently located to find breakfast and it is nice to sit in the air conditioned lobby waiting for your train rather than in the hot crowded station with no place to sit.	The exterior windows are amazingly sound proof, 	but insert earplugs before you realize you need them, because the interior walls are not soundproof and conversations in the hall and adjacent room will disrupt sleep.	Otherwise, clean and modern rooms providing basic needs for a layover.
This certainly isn't the most posh hotel in Italy, 	but it's conveniently located across from the train station, clean, and fine for a night.	The rooms are fairly bare-bones 	but clean.	The breakfast buffet is decent.	The location can't be beat, the staff is helpful and the price is reasonable.	Not an extended stay kind of place, 	but fine for a night or two.
This hotel is very clean and modern, 	although not very sound proof windows allow in the outside noise.	Check in was painful due to lack of available staff, which may have been unusual, 	but maybe not...	Location is very convenient to walking areas, shops, and the station.	Computer did not function, so could not print tickets.	Noticed several guests had issues with room keys, 	but our was fine.	Overall we would recommend this hotel for a short stay, 	but search elsewhere for longer options.
Good hotel overall.	Central location (opposite station), yet quiet, rooms large and comfortable, nice modern decoration throughout, friendly staff and good breakfast.	But ... only one coffee machine for breakfast, only one employee at reception.	Plan to queue at breakfast, check_in, check_out, getting your car out of the garage, etc ... A few details easy to fix 	but which can get really annoying in an otherwise very acceptable hotel.
Great location for station 	but in a run down area[most of Pisa is run down]From here great base to visit this part of Italy.From airport get bus to station cost about 1.20 euro each wayBreakfast not to bad 	but don't expect a good hot selection.My room 406 good size and room service good.	Internet also good.For the money best aroundBus outside hotel for the Tower area 1 euro single walking 20/25 mins
This hotel is very convenient for travel to the airport by either shuttle bus or taxi.	The breakfast is served in a lovely bright room with a fantastic selection of fresh fruit, yogurts, croissants etc,.There is also bacon, eggs etc for those who like an English breakfast.	However,  having started with what I liked about this hotel, regrettably our reservation for a Superior room didn't match our expectations when we arrived.	If this was a Superior room I can't imagine what a standard room would look like.	The room was exceptionally small and the bed was a basic double which was pushed up against the wall.	The person sleeping on the inside would have to climb into bed over their partner or try and slide in by the end of the bed.	As elderly travellers we found this arrangement totally unsuitable.	I thought that perhaps we had been allocated a single room by mistake and therefore asked the receptionist to change the room.	All we needed was a decent size bed with enough space around it to allow us to get in and out of bed in a normal way.After a lot of discussion with her colleague at the reception desk we agreed with the receptionist to be upgraded to a suite 	even though a proper Superior room would have been fine which was what we had booked in the first place.	I got the impression that a suite was the only alternative.	The suite consisted of a living room with a very shaky spiral staircase leading to two bedrooms.	We didn't need all this space 	but the extra tariff was fairly minimal.	The bedrooms in the suite are lit by a small long window at ceiling height so there is no connection with the outside world just a blank wall.	Okay for one night 	but I would not like to stay in this room for any longer.	In the end we had a lovely large bed with crisp linen and had a splendid nights sleep so a happy ending.	I would recommend this hotel 	but make sure that you get what you asked for in your reservation.
Boutique hotel which was tastefully decorated and clean.	Excellent buffet breakfast with a huge choice - only problem was the single hot drinks machine which was very slow, hence there was often a bit of a queue.	Our room (I think No.	202) was clean and well-stocked 	but perhaps not as modern as some of the other rooms.	Excellent location being opposite the train and bus stations and not far to walk into the centre of Pisa.
Here for 2 nights on a city break booked through BA, excellent value.	The staff here are so pleasant and attentive and make you feel welcome.	The bed was large and very comfy and room was sooooo warm on a cold day.	Bathroom was decent size 	but none of the sink plugs fitted which was a challenge.....Breakfast buffet was superb and so much choice.	Recommend this hotel very much.	Its great for shopping areas and transport.	A little on the quiet side in the evening 	but would happily return here.	Thanks NH hotel Pisa
Just across from the main station and just around the corner from the main shopping street.	A clean and well organised hotel.	We had a good room with a small balcony with views over the station.	The hotel was surprisingly quiet despite it great position next to the station.
Originally chose this hotel due to its location across the plaza from the main station.	Staff more than happy to check us in early and friendly and helpful with directions and advice.The room was very large, beds extremely comfortable and a well sized bathroom 	although the shower was over the bath which could be an issue with those less mobile.	Cleaning was to a high standard.Breakfast was amazing with a huge choice of foods from a well stocked buffet.Walk to the Leaning Tower was about 20 minutes 	but plenty to see on the way really the only way to experience a city.Day trip to Lucca by train very cheap and plenty of trains.Would stay here again and always recommend.
Great hotel with a perfect location, just accross the Pisa Centrale.	Stuff is helpful and nice.	Very good breakfast.	we stayed 2 nights and due to the close location to the train station, the visit to Florence was really convenient.	The Leaning Tower of Pisa is like 20 mins on foot.	I was really pleased.	For sure this is my hotel in case of a new visit in the region.	Keep up the great service!
We arrived early to the NH Cavalieri, and I was a little worried having read some negative reviews, 	but thankfully everything went smoothly.	There was no problem and we were given a room straight away.	Check in was a little slow, 	but nothing to complain about.	The room we were given was small, 	but very clean and the bed was very comfortable and fresh.	Toiletries were provided, and a good hairdryer too.	Breakfast was lovely, cheeses, meats, scrambled eggs etc.	The hotel is right across from the station, which was handy as we took a trip to Florence for one day (8 euro each way).	We found the staff very pleasant.	The air conditioning was great, effective and not loud.	About a 20/30 minute walk to the tower.	All in all we were very happy and would go back.	( Taxi from the airport was so handy and cost 8 euro)
Good hotel right outside the station so Airport to room in 15 mins at a cost of euro 1.30.	Warning do not book a taxi especially through Travel Republic they will rip you off by charging Â£50Opposite end of the town to the leaning tower 	but a nice 20 min walk down the shopping streets Buffet style breakfast included
we used this hotel at the start of our holiday.	Pisa only deserves a one-day visit really and this hotel is located opposite the railway station and only a short 10-ish minute walk to the Leaning Tower area.	It's perfect as a sightseeing location and somewhere where there is easy access to the eating houses
Let's begin with the staff.	Most (almost all) of the staff at this hotel act as 	though they no longer want a job.	They are unfriendly, have an inability to smile, and are attempting to create a corporate feel, 	but have sadly failed in this.I have stayed at this hotel on two separate occasions in the same week, and found that it is definitely worth paying slightly more to lodge in a 'Superior' room.	It has a more modern feel, significantly more powerful air conditioning, a better bathroom, and (as should be standard in my opinion) has a kettle.	However, I must note that in both rooms the soundproofing is excellent.	Additionally, the WiFi worked well in both rooms with no additional charge.	Considering the impersonal and corporate feel of the hotel, it is surprising that their TV channel selection is poor, and flat screen sets are only found in Superior rooms.	Disappointingly, the card keys only worked occasionally, and I had to go up and down the stairs a few times to sort this out.Overall, the hotel is sufficient, and the location is useful, with the train station, and a shuttle bus to the airport on the doorstep.	Also on the positive side, Breakfast at NH Cavalieri is reasonably good, and I particularly enjoyed their panna cotta on a few occasions!	Despite this, I wouldn't stay at the hotel again if I were able to find something else for a reasonable price in the area.
We stayed here for one night on our way to Florence.	We were very impressed by the hotel and staff.	Very clean and modern room, with balcony and view.	Lovely clean bathroom.	We loved Pisa and hope to return to this hotel again!
The hotel is in a great location for access to the main train station and buses.	It is also only about 20 minutes of a stroll from the main sights.	However, the staff were generally cold, unhelpful and sexist preferring to talk to my male partner over me 	even though the booking and payment were in my name.	They went as far as changing the name on the booking into my partner's surname after photocopying our passports.	How rude!	We booked a Superior Room and we did not get a double bed.	Instead we got two singles on wheels pushed together, which moved at the slightest turn.	This was not conducive to a good nights sleep.	The room did not have a spare blanket and was actually cold at night despite turning the air con off.	We did not have bathrobes or a sofa-bed as described in room facilities description.	The room was clean and presentably stylish 	but small.	It did have a nice bathroom and bath 	but there was a big stain on the ceiling.	The walls were thin and we could hear our neighbours television and talking during the night.	There was tea making facilities 	but no coffee or milk provided.	We did ring reception to ask for some 	but they couldn't help us.	Overall, not a friendly or helpful staff.
WHAT VALUE FOR MONEY.	Stayed at the Jolly Cavalieri for 2 nights commencing 14th November 2008.	Having read some of the reviews prior to making our choice we were a little unsure of what to expect .	Although most reviews were favourable some were not so.	However for approx Â£60+ per night for a twin bedded room I think you would struggle to beat the quality offerred at this price.	Having now stayed there I would happily have paid a lot more.	I can only echo the sentiments already expressed by many... excellent location... friendly staff.... walking distance to all amenities (including tower).. modern....clean...accommodating (arrived early and still able to access room).... lots of choice at breakfast.	Hotel looks like it has been newly built or recently refurbished.	We stayed on the 4th floor.	The room was adequate in size with  quality contemporary fixtures and fittings.	One helpful tip for those, who like us, have a poor sense of direction or an inability to accurately read a map...	If you intend walking to the tower (torre) turn right then right when you come out from the front of the hotel.	If like us you turn left you will turn a 30min walk into an hour!!
I stayed here for one night in June 2007 before leaving by air the next day.	Location: The hotel is located right next to the train station and bus stop that will take you directly to the airport.	There are a number of restaurants and eating facilities around the hotel.	It's a bit far from the leaning tower, 	but there's a bus stop right outside the hotel that'll take you to Piazza della Miracoli and the LEaning Tower.	It took about ten minutes and didn't cost much.	And 	even though I stayed there on a Sunday the buses ran quite frequently.Service: I traveled alone and was welcomed by a very pleasant receptionist who booked me on the second floor, close to the elevator.	If you're a woman and traveling alone it Italy it is not unusal for the hotel staff to take extra care of you and make sure you're in a room you're comfortabel with.	Room: The room wasn't all that big 	but it was more than adequate for me.	IT was modern, clean and bright with air-condtion and a tv that had a number of English-speaking channels as well as a great selection of music.	The only complaint I have is that my duvet wasn't entierly clean, 	but that was also the only thing that wasn't spotless in this room.	The view from my hotel room was nothing to write home about, my window overlooked other buildings and laundry strings full of clothes, 	but I didn't really mind...didn't spend much time in the room anyway.Breakfast: Didn't try it.I liked my stay here.	It was a hotel with a very buisniss like feel to it, so I you're looking for a charming Italian feeling hotel this might not be your place, 	but for anyone else I'd reccomend it.
The reviews I read before going varied immensely, decided to try it both forth the location  reasoable price as I was flying out early next morning.	What a suprise, Pietro at check in was extremely professional, later at the counter when he was checking in a group, handled all questions without everyone waiting in line.	This is a very contemporary hotel, that lobby  half the rooms just  were completely redone.	Hotel looks more french than Italian, right across the street from central train  bus station.	Cabs are there also  with a 5 min trip to airport which cost E7 includes cost of 2 pcs luggage.
Loved this hotel!	Had a long weekend there last week - we arrived at 10.30am and our room was all ready for us, which was a pleasant surprise.	The bed was the most comfy hotel bed I have ever experienced, and the bathroom looked like no-one had ever used it before us, it was that clean.	Also the room faced the station 	but we didn't hear a sound from outside the whole time due to the super-efficient double glazing.The buffet breakfast was lovely, lots of choice for me as I am veggie, 	but beware the scrambled egg, as it contained small bits of bacon.The staff were helpful enough, 	but we too had the problem with the key card which deactivated at least once a day, and that's the reason (as well as the scrambled egg!)	why this gets 4 stars instead of 5.
Recently returned from a stay at the cavalieri overall enjoyed our stay very handy for the railway station with good links to Florence and spent a lovely day at the coast in Viarreggio only 15 mins by train.Hotel reception staff not particularly welcoming and had a problem with keycard after each use.	No local info available at the hotel having said that leaning tower only about a 20minute walk away.Lovely buffet breakfast 	but dinner menu limited got a good deal with alpharooms Â£60 per night for a twin room.	Room very nice on the first floor recently refurbished spotlessly clean with lovely bathroom, would highly recommend.
Excellent hotel and excellent staff.	I'm at this hotel often the staff always treats their customers like family.	Location is perfect, in the city center, and closeness to the train station.	Plenty of restaurants in the area.	Main shopping street is right around the corner.
Excellent location.	Exceptionally clean hotel and friendly staff.	We stayed from 1.8.2015 to 5.8.2015 in room 515.	A superior room with a large bed which was comfortable.	Well stocked fridge and safe as standard in this superior room.	Breakfast very fresh and a good variety.	Efficient restaurant staff.	Would thoroughly recommend.	Only one small comment was not aware till check out of the check out tax of â‚¬16.	Maybe I missed it in the small print.
I stayed in this hotel 2 years ago with my son as we had a couple of days to kill before we were due to meet with relatives at Pisa airport.	I had chosen this hotel because it was right opposite Pisa Centrale railway station and we had decided that whilst we had time to kill we'd visit Florence.	Staying here made this so very easy, the hotel room was one of the brightest, cleanest rooms i've ever stayed in, we'd upgraded so that it would make it more of a treat and it certainly was, there wasn't anything we had to ask for, in the bathroom there was everything from body lotions to razors, my son said it was the best hotel he'd ever stayed in.	Last week myself and partner stayed here for one night only, as i was highly recommending it to him and we wanted to be close enough to the main attraction, nice restaurants and importantly again the train station.	We arrived very early, before the room was ready 	but it wasn't a problem, i was shown to a bathroom where i could change out of my travelling clothes, our luggage was safely stored and we headed out for an afternoon of sightseeing.	When we returned we headed to the room, it was so beautifully cool and air conditioned, once again there was everything we could have needed, and we will definitely stay there again.	Lovely location, lovely staff and the breakfast was excellent.
This hotel is perfectly located as a base for touring the area, close to buses, train station and taxis.	It overlooks a paved area with a fountain 	but despite the fact there are numerous people on the move the area is kept clean and tidy with benches to enjoy people watching.It is within walking distance of the Leaning Tower and the Duomo and there are good restaurants and bars close by.	There is a wide selection of shops to delight anyone who enjoys retail therapy.After a day sightseeing/touring/shopping the hotel offers well proportioned rooms with comfortable beds and pillows with crispy sheets and lots of hot water for a shower/bath.	Efficient sound proofing and air con.	There is an excellent choice  for breakfast and they will cater for special requests.	Excellent coffee!!!!	The staff are efficient and friendly all in all a great venue and value for money.
Excellent location near the railway station Pisa Centrale, within walking distance of sights, friendly staff, excellent service, cleanliness, new plumbing, air conditioning, good sound insulation, varied breakfast buffet
This hotel is opposite the railway station, 	but the area is quite pleasant compared to many station locations.	The hotel is modern, clean, comfortable and good value.	The staff are helpful and the breakfast is good, with a spacious breakfast room.	The hotel is close to Corsa Italia for shopping and not to far from the Piazza dei Miracoli for the obvious sights, maybe around 20 minutes on foot, unless you stop for a drink of course.
The hotel's location is just outside the railway station, it could be an option.My room is a standard single, quite small and definitively below any standard for a 4 star hotel.	There are numerous shortcomings, few plugs far form the bed, furniture outdated, absence of cleanness feeling, mirror absent in the bathroom.	The minibar and the breakfast prices are proportional to a 4 star, however...Reading the reviews it seems that part of the hotel has been renewed, well, it seems that I got the still-to-be-renewed part.	For the price I paid much better hotels are available.Wifi is included and of fast enough.Personnel is kind and professional.
perfect location for visiting Pisa, Florence, Lucca, Sienna and Cinque Terre.	Great rooms, friendly staff and good breakfast.	Visited this hotel now 3 times and never had a bad experience.Recommened it.
Having just got back from 3 nights in this hotel I can certainly recommend staying here!Situated directly opposite the train station and walking distance from Pisa airport, this hotel is smart, clean, contemporary and I had no problems during my stay here.The breakfast is above average, the coffee from the self service machine is excellent... this coming from a bit of a coffee snob too!
You can get off the train in Pisa and walk a reasonably short distance to the hotel - having cases with wheels would be helpful if they were heavy 	though.	Room was very nice and so was the included breakfast.	Room was modern, clean and comfortable.	Plenty of choice with breakfast.	Hotel was well priced too and 	though we chose it for its proximity to the train station and the fact we were there only one night, we would have happily stayed there for longer if needs be.
Arrived from Pisa Airport to take a quick tour of the Pisa sights.	Fantastic location opposite the train station, 4 star hotel, clean, organised, comfortableand reasonably priced.	Situated about 15 mins from the Leaning Tower, Cathedral etc giving a pleasant walk through the main shopping area and over the river
I stayed in this hotel several times from July and September as a major airline crew member.	The rooms very always ready at the time of check-in which is a big plus 	although if you request a room facing the train station they always make you wait for a while before it's ready.	The corner rooms are very small and dark.	Giuliana and Laura are the only friendly receptionists and they are very helpful and professional.	They were always smiling and greeting me.	Five stars to them.
When I travel Italy I use the trains, from the train station walk out, cross the street and you're there!	And you do not hear the trains, it is a good neighborhood.	This is a Spanish owned hotel chain, clean and modern.	Not only is it easy access to the train station, go out, take a right and another right at the main street and great shopping/food and on your way to see the Leaning Tower.	Highly recommend.
I was waiting for a bad hotel considering some of the reviews however a family member said it was perfect for touring and recommended it.	All the staff including reception/housekeeping and breakfast were friendly and polite and informative.	Check in was painless.	Room was amazingly quiet as I was expecting it to be noisy as it is dead opposite the main station.	Good double double glazing!	Dark curtains so no early light in.	Pillows even soft and comfy.	Bed too hard for myself 	but that is just personal preference.	I was on the second floor with superior double.	They had to change to a twin after two days as I was being joined by my daughter.	No trouble.	They even had a locker for everything as I was out all day in Florence whilst the changeover happened.	The room was very clean and well appointed.	Contemporary with no fuss .	Breakfast was lovely.	Eggs/bacon/cold selection/good fruit and yoghurt and gluten free .	Fab coffee and the girls ran around for me as my diet is not the norm!All in all a very surprising find and brilliant for just walking across the road to catch the trains to the cinque terra/Firenze/Livorno/anywhere in fact...
We booked 1 night at the NH Pisa because it was so close to the train station.	In fact, it's directly across the street.	Since there were 3 of us, I booked the 'suite with terrace' and was shocked to find out it was a giant bi-level suite with it's own spiral staircase, living room, 2 bathrooms, 2 bedrooms, etc.	What a HUGE space for a decent bargain.	The television in the master bedroom was bigger than we have at home!	The beds were comfortable, the bathrooms clean and modern, the terrace was fun to stand on late at night and people-watch at the train station across the street.	We took a cab to the Leaning tower the next day, got lost trying to walk back, the hotel safely watched our luggage all day until we took a train out that afternoon.	I was really pleased with our stay and the service.	I will be more likely to try another &quot;NH&quot; brand hotel after this nice experience.
I was traveling better London, UK and Florence, Italy on business.	It was best to fly into Pisa and then take the fast train from Pisa to Florence.I arrived in Pisa late in the afternoon so I decided to stay at a hotel close to the main train station of Pisa and found this place.Very nice hotel - clean, easy check-in, helpful staff, comfortable room, good WiFi, English-speaking channels on the TV, reasonably priced, and convenient location.	All good and I would stay here again.
This NH hotel sits right across from the train station.	From there, you can explore this region with ease.	However, the hotel lobby is steps away from a busy bus stop.	Just around the hotel facade, the street merchants have their goods spread on the ground.	It is one of the reasons that friends told me to make Lucca my base if I want to visit Tuscany.	The rooms are fine, 	but again, it does not have iron and board.	One has to call house keeping for it.	The staff is friendly and knowledgeable, 	but I may just take the friend's advice and stay in Lucca next time.
Hotel is very convenient for the airport, especially for early flights and of a good standard.	Breakfast was  very good and the bedrooms very good for the price.	Well placed for seeing the sights of Pisa.	Would recommend for anyone wanting a few days in Pisa before catching the bus to the airport.	Would definitely stay here again.Just remember to buy your bus tickets from the newspaper kiosk at the railway station before trekking across the railway station to the bus stop with heavy cases Alternatively make sure you have change for the bus.
The rooms of this hotel are of very good standard.	They are clean and well keept, their are &quot;eye&quot; for the small detail that can make all the change.The service from the personal are good, helpful and very friendly.Local of the hotel can't be much better, it is easy to get to and from here you can walk and see all of Pisa.	With the location just across from trainstation you can't get it much more easy, no matter if you come by plain, there is a bus directly from airport to trainstation, or train.
Visited NH Pisa hotel and had a really lovely time.	Reception staff, Nicola, was efficient in booking us in and very helpful when we enquired about travel, restaurants and places of interest.	Our room, 307, was adequate for our stay and was cleaned daily with clean towels put out and toiletries etc.	Also useful having a fridge in the room and air conditioning that worked!	!The Buffett breakfast was excellent with a choice of hot and cold food.	The coffee machine serves a great cup of coffee and it is freshly made every time you use it.	Maria is one of the waitresses who has a smile for you every morning.	All the staff in the dining room should be complimented as they are there to please the guests and they go out of their way to be helpful.	The eating area is clean and airy and the staff work effortlessly to provide a very good service.I would recommend this hotel without hesitation and if going to Pisa again I would certainly use it.
It is really the best and practical hotel for one night stay in Pisa.Nice bedroom, good breakfast and super location of the hotel.	The hotel is modern and well decorated.Great place where to sleep in Pisa :)
This is the 3rd time we have stayed in this hotel and each stay only gets better.the staff throughout the hotel,reception,housekeeping and dining are efficient,friendly and helpful.the rooms were spotless and the beds extremely comfortable with crisp white bed linen.	Nicoli on reception recommended a traditional Italian restaurant close by which was amazing and we weren't rushed from our rooms on departure day.	We couldn't ask for more.	Thank you to all
Good value, modern clean hotel right opposite the station, so no excuse not to visit Luca  (20 mins on the train).	The tower in Pisa is about 20 minutes walk 	but it is worth it and is a pleasant walk 	though medieval streets.
Stayed one night on trip to Pisa.Welcomed warmly by Nicola on reception.	Nice, clean, quiet, comfortable hotel.Would recommend it.Breakfast excellent.	Just a short walk from the Leaning Tower, worth the walk.Two minutes from the station.
Maria on reception is wonderful and always kind and ready to help.	I stay often as my airline have used the hotel for some years now and is probably the best in Pisa.	It is also very convienant for the attractions and town.	Maria always makes one so welcome I look forward to staying there.
Hotel is opposite station so convenient, able to walk to all the sights.	Hotel is clean, stylish and modern, breakfast is very good and the staff are so friendly.	Not our first stay and definitely not our last.	Thank you all for your help
Stayed for one night only since we had an early morning flight from Pisa.	Both of us wished we had more time to enjoy the hotel.	Very clean, staff was extremely friendly and helpful and the location is superb.	(Next to the train station and within walking distance of restaurants and shopping!)	Because our flight was very early the next day, we weren't able to have the breakfast.	Perfect hotel if you're touring the Tuscan region by train.	Highly recommend it.
I was diss  with the room being next to the lift as ever time the lift was used there was such a banging and clattering, also very disappointed that no tea and coffee facilities  where available  unless you had a 'superior ' room I was told by reception.When you book a 4 star hotel you expect all rooms to have this facility.
Stayed for 1 night, early September.	Room was a good size, very clean, bathroom had everything you needed.	We had breakfast included and the rate was really very reasonable.	So close to the train station and a couple of nice bars close by.Wouldn't hesitate to stay here again.
One night stay on way to airport.	Very modern.	Would suit Mr Gadget Man.	Minimalism theme.	Acquired taste 	but not for us.	Quality of en suite furnishings poor.	En suite was a wet room.	Seemed a good idea until you showered.	Water stays on whole of floor like a swimming pool.	Simply cleaning your teeth meant going for a paddle.The staff were extremely unfriendly and unwelcoming.	They were reluctant to help with an air conditioning problem in our room.	We asked about the best way to get to the airport.	A 10 euro taxi ride for around a mile was not a good reccommendation.	The train or bus (right outside the hotel) is cheaper and just as easy.	We were not told about this.	It was clean and remarkably quiet considering its location.	All was very clinical however.	The previous 12 days in Italy had been wonderful.	A pity this hotel spoiled it.	Go to the Grand Hotel Bonnano instead.	Not quite a good a location 	but a hotel full of character and charm and with a friendly and welcoming staff.
I would recommend this hotel to anyone who wants guaranteed a lovely, very modern hotel and stylish room for a good value.	Location is right across from train station and walking distance to great stores, restaurants, etc.	Try to get a room with a balcony, it's worth it.	Wonderful breakfast, too with good variety, fresh fruit and anything else you would want.
Stayed for one night this month July 09.	Whole hotel appeared to have been refurbed, my room was tiny, couldn't swing a cat in it, 	but was clean, nicely designed and comfortable.	Rate was Euros 102 last minute just showing up.	Great location for the train station and 5 mins to the airport, 	but a fair walk to the touristy stuff.	Not the kind of area to be wandering around at night - lots of beggars and general train station undesirables.	Didn't have breakfast 	but would imagine its nice.	Staff were extremely efficient bordering on rude.	Not spectacular 	but its Pisa so what do you expect?	Would try and choose something nearer to centre and a bit less clinical next time.
Half the hotel has been refurbished and half hasn't.	If you're in the refurbished bit its a very nice, modern hotel.	If you're not, its crap.	We were there for one night and managed to sample both.	We were in a non refurbished room until 1.30am when the aircon noisily failed.	By 2.00am we were in one of the refurbished rooms which was very nice.	Location wise its a fair walk to the Tower, 	but close to the train station.	Your a fair way from the main tourist areas, 	but other wise the location is OK.
Spent three nights here as a base to explore Pisa, Florence  Lucca before moving on to self catering  in Tuscany.50 out of the 100 rooms had been refurbished to  incredibly  high standards .	Our Bathroom  was 4*   Beds  hugely comfortable.	Room faced onto sguare fronting  Station ( bus  train)   Double Glazing / sound proofingfine.	Great for  watching the world go by.Buffet Breakfasts  give  good range  of  cerials, fruits, cold meats, plus  croissants , toast etc.	The hot cabinet has bacon   scambled egg.There is a restaurant, not cheap, and not tried.	Lots of  eating places nearby 	but @ tourist prices.	Main meals, Pizza/Pasta  8 euros.	Glass beer /wine  3euros.Reception  helpful   English speaking .As a base to explore  Florence, Lucca and even Sienna by rail after having done the obligatory  Leaning Tower, ( buses depart outside hotel 1 euro)  this hotel is ideal.	The remaining 50 rooms are to be refurbished  ready for  the 2010 season.Airport bus stops outside .	( 1 euro ticket from info desk at Pisa Airport)  Don't take train.	More expensive  walking.. Good  last minute deals available.	60/90 euros per room.
The hotel is in an exceptional situation, facing the main train station and very close to a public parking in case you travel by car.Transportation to the city center (old center) by bus is very easy from the front of the hotel and the Pisa airport is just 15 min away by taxi or the &quot;shuttle train&quot; leaving from the main train station.The hotel itself is old, 	although some minor renovation is made, still the rooms are very old fashioned, the walls, wardrobe, bathroom tiles are damaged.The rooms are small, yet very quite.The breakfast is relatively good and with a good service.
Excellent location opposite to train station.	Helpful staff.	They have arranged extra child bed on our request.	Provided information about the area, public transport and restaurant.	Clean and good sized rooms.	Had nice experience.
This is NOT 4 star hotel.	It's a 2 star hotel.	Rooms with broken glasses, closet doors with holes, dirty walls, bathrooms from the 80s, dirty carpets.	It's a shame for NH hotels.	See the pictures attached.
Staffs extremely rude.	I went to Pisa on a work trip and closed the hotel on an internet site.	I stayed two weeks in a row.	In the first I made the payment at the hotel and got the receipt as necessary, the second weekend the payment was also made at the hotel, 	but the staff refused to give me a receipt, being extremely rude because I had closed on a website.	But payment was made at the hotel, so it is the responsibility of the hotel to give the receipt, as was done the previous week.	I wrote to the hotel several times, after contacting the website and confirming the hotel's obligation to provide me with the receipt and I did not have any answers.	Also, the room is very small and nothing comfortable.	Sorry for this atitute.	Never again am I in one of NH!
Large spacious room with comfortable bed.	Very clean.	Location is across the road from Pisas train station.	A bit of a walk from Leaning Tower 	but within a 15 minute walk.	Lots of shops and restaurants in the area.
An excellent hotel in every respect, with no criticisms.	Especially friendly and helpful staff, with a professional attitude.	One of the best we have stayed.	Good value .	We stayed on two separate occasions  in two different rooms and each was of a good standard with superb fittings
Great hotel just across the road from Pisa main rail station and 5 minute taxi drive from the airport.	Reception was very modern and accommodating as were the staff.	We stayed in a double room for one night with views facing the rail way station entrance.	The room was comfortable and clean, however the deco was a little tired and needed a update, 	but the price was reasonable and the room had everything we needed (apart from a kettle and tea facilities 	but these were provided downstairs in the lobby).	Breakfast was great, there lots of choice and something for everyone.
So my girlfriend and I spent the weekend in Pisa thanks to Ryanair, staying at the NH who lured me in with their refurbished rooms, seeing the leaning tower in the rain and helping the Italian economy by spending some money in their &quot;Saldi&quot; (	although I have to say that in Belgium the reductions are bigger by now).	The hotel was..... average I'd say.	The room was indeed refurbished, 	but I guess they had forgotten about the lamp above the bed because that just contained some electrical wires taped together.	Also the controlled airconditioning meant it was quite warm in the room, the double door to the balcony of which one was not really refurbished is a bit ..... mmmmmmmm....... small things 	but nonetheless I felt a bit less than satisfied when paying the bill.	Breakfast for a 4-star is .... average.	Needs some work, 	although the staff were nice and helpful.
Stayed here after an evening flight, en route to another Tuscan town.	Hotel had perfect location (airport bus stopped outside and train station opposite).	Staff helpful and willing to spend time with map talking through how to get to Pisa sights next day, not too far to walk/bus.	Hotel lovely.Paid for upgraded room, great decor and bathroom.	Imagined I would've slept well on the comfy bed had a large group of non eu tourists arrived at 12pm, very, very, very, noisy for hours til I passed out with exhaustion around 6am I think!	They were consistently walking up and down the corridors, shouting and what seemed like singing rather loud in the next room... Tv didn't drown them out.	Due to convenient location expect bus loads at random times and busy breakfast room!	Shame staff didn't care to ask them nicely to keep quiet, oh well.... nice start to a honeymoon eh?	Wouldn't advise ppl avoid as hotel soooo handy 	but do make a point of the noise if it happens!!!
The hotel was opposite the train station and the bus stop for the airport or central Pisa stops right outside.	The room was a little shabby, 	but perfectly comfortable, and we were on the top floor with a balcony.	The staff were all very friendly.	Breakfast was lovely.	Previous negative reviews gave talked about the self service coffee machine.	This is what you would expect to find in a city centre chain hotel, and the coffee it produced was definitely strong and Italian!	We stayed 2 nights, and it was very convenient as we took the train to Florence one day, and were able to walk to the leaning tower very quickly.	We would definitely return.
We only stayed here one night and were here solely to see the leaning tower which takes about 20 minutes to walk from the hotel.	The room was basic and clean.	The hotel was being refurbished 	but unfortunately the room we were in wasnâ€™t one of them 	but the refurbished rooms look good.	It is in a good location for the train station as that is just across the road.	The lifts are slow and shudder which is slightly unnerving.Breakfast was ok 	but the floor was sticky to walk on  There was free WIFI in the lobby area.
Steps from the main railway station and only 1km from Pisa airport, and a short walk to the old town centre and the Leaning Tower of Pisa.	This four star hotel isn't exactly in the best area of town, 	but it is convenient.However, the four star rating is exaggerated as it fails to deliver.	Though comfortable, I left the hotel feeling let down by the service, a lack of attention, and poorly maintained in-room facilities.Room 107 was a good size with two twin beds, high ceilings, patio doors with small balcony overlooking the square of the Pisa Central train station.	The bathroom was large and clean, a good selection of soap and shower gels.	A good size closet, and small desk made this a decent room overall.The TV turned on, 	but had no channels or 'no service available at this time' the entire stay.	The mini bar fridge wasn't working, leaving me with a selection of overpriced warm drinks.	One of the two lamps by the bed did not function.	No extra outlets for charging mobiles or electronic devices, except in bathroom where a spare plug for electric shaver was available.Reception and hallways were modern and clean.	The breakfast was a good selection for a hotel in Italy, 	but nothing exceptional.Nh Cavalieri served its purpose, 	but am disappointed the hotel fell short of expectations for a 4 star, 	but this is Italy where most things are generally over-rated, I shouldn't have expected the quality of Nh Hotels, at least not in Pisa.
The NH Cavalieri is an average hotel, nothing special 	but met our requirements quite nicely.	The Good:  Located across the road from the train station which makes it a great place to use as a base to explore Tuscany - Firenze and Lucca can be reached quite easily and inexpensively.	There are lots of local restaurants - try Da Michele on the street at the back of the hotel.	Plenty of toiletries in the room.	Breakfast was pretty good with a wide selection the only complaint was the coffee.The Bad: Small rooms with dated decoration and a lumpy bed with a mattress that was well overdue replacing.	Polite 	but not very friendly staff, no evening restaurant, no bar, air conditioning was noisy and could not be turned off.	Breakfast Coffee from a vending machine - in Italy- unbelievableFinally, nothing to do with the hotel 	but the train station area is the haunt of street hawkers selling all sorts of counterfeit goods and there are also high numbers of beggars.	Make sure you keep your personal belongings, wallets and purses secure.	Pickpockets operate in the area.
Myself and my colleagues stayed in this Hotel for 5 nights.	The hotel was very clean and the staff helpful.	Unfortunately this hotel had no hot water for at least two the mornings we stayed, when we complained no one seemed bothered about this at all.	The rooms were a bit on the cold side.	The breakfast was pretty poor, food was ok 	but there was no cutlery on a few occasions and we had to ask for a tea cup most mornings.	Tables were never cleared and very dirty.	I don't think we will be staying at this hotel again when we plan our next trip to Pisa
I have been treated very well by the staff of this hotel.	At the desk, at the restaurant, by the people of housekeeping and especially by Guiliana, who has put me in the room of my request, and helped me very carefully with some checkin/-out requests.	I liked my room.	This was money well spent.	Well worth it.
Excellent location: by the railway station and Pisa Mover to the airport.	(The airport itself is understaffed and lacks sufficient infrastructure for the number of passengers.	On a busy day, arrive early; it took us nearly an hour to go through security.)	It's a twenty-minute walk to the Leaning Tower.	There are some good restaurants nearby, and the main shopping street is five minutes up the road.	The room was nicely decorated in light wood tones, the bathroom was fine, bed comfortable, and good sound insolation: no noise from the station!	The breakfast was Ok, I suppose, 	but NH breakfasts lag behind other major hotel chains.
The lobby is nicely decorated.	However, the room is big, 	but very out-dated.	Carpet was worn down.	It's right cross the train station.	If you close the window, the noise won't bother your sleep.	Breakfast was just average.	Bed was not comfortable.
