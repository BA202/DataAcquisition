The premises are very peaceful and well maintained.	1
The apartment was spacious though basically equipped.	1
We enjoyed the fine pool and good food.	1
But the hospitality was overwhelming!	1
These people are so friendly and helpful that you'd never want to leave again.	1
After a small accident with a child that needed stitching in the hospital the brought us there and picked us up again and arranged some snacks during the waiting.	1
Arriving back at the hotel after midnight we found the complete staff waiting to welcome us and then preparing dinner.	1
Really a moment never to forget	1
5 min drive out of Pisa or you need to catch the Bus, too far to walk.	2
Beautiful self-contained apartments, well appointed with plenty of space, very clean.	2
Great pool area with spa and massage area downstairs.	2
My family of 5 stayed at the residence San Rossore for 8 nights.	3
We had a great time mainly due to the pool, 	3
friendliness of the staff, 	3
and a good base for exploring.(The attractions in Pisa, Lucca, Florence, and the Beach)	3
The villas are huge and very functional which is a key requirement for a young family.	3
The kitchen mainly comprises of a hob and a fridge so is fairly basic.	3
We tendered to eat out most nights so this wasn't a problem 	3
but when staying in had no problem with cooking pasta from the local 'deli'.	3
The apartment only has Italian TV therefore those travelling with kids may wish to bring a Dvd player or laptop for their evening entertainment.	3
The Italian breakfast served in the bar area was a tasty and leisurely start to each day.	3
We stayed here for a couple of nights on the way down to Tuscany	4
 needed somewhere that was clean  	4
had a pool.	4
There seem to be very few hotels in or around Pisa that have pools 	4
 are reasonably priced.	4
This fits both bills.	4
The apartment was clean, 	4
and there was a bar in the hotel itself to get drinks, snacks  a well priced breakfast at 5 euros per person (croissant, coffee, juice  cereal).	4
It had wi-fi which was 5 euro per 24 hours.	4
It also had parking  	4
was well situated to visit Pisa  the coast.	4
All in all, it was basic, 	4
but perfect for an overnight stay.	4
The accomodation was simple 	5
but more than adequate.	5
Spotlessly clean and very spacious.	5
pool area was very pleasant - 	5
the highlight was the level of service.	5
Thanks to Petra for sorting out a mix-up with the booking and letting us check out in the afternoon on the day we left.	5
Great ceentre for exploring Pisa and the surrounding areas.	5
We booked this accomodation with a group of six people for our stay in Pisa during a conference.	6
Although the accomodation was quite far from the city centre and the conference center, it was easy to get there by bus (only 1 euro) or taxi.	6
Petra was quite happy to help you arrange a taxi or provide you with any tourist information.	6
She was very friendly and helpful, always smiling and really gave us a pleasant and welcome stay at the residence.	6
We enjoyed having to opportunity to have a quick dive in the swimming pool at the end of our day before going out for dinner.	6
The appartment was clean and spacious.	6
As we did not have a car, the supermarket was quite a bit of a walk.	6
The Hostel is in a pretty good location, about a 15 min walk from the airport and the directions were pretty good.	7
and then about a 10 min walk to the Tower and only a 2 min walk to the train station.	7
The Room wasnt the best, we stayed in a female dorm on the ground floor and didn't seem very secure, the room door didn't have a lock and the front door of the hostel was open all the time.	7
The room had a locker for everyone, however the one we were allocated didnt lock.	7
Not the cleanist place, I got bed bugs here.	7
The bathrooms werent the best either, there was 2 dorms on the ground floor and only 2 bathrooms.	7
There was no water pressure at all, had to have a cold shower.	7
While travelling around, I spend one night in Station Pisa hostel with 3 friends.	8
The 4-bed room we had booked was clean but really simple and the beds were 2 bunkbeds, no problem for us but might be a problem for other age groups.	8
The bathroom was shared with another room but clean as well.	8
It's location is perfect, between the airport and the centre, on the other hand Pisa is a rather small city, so everything is in walking distance.	8
As far as I saw, most people in the hostel were young travellers, which is also the age group I would recommend this hostel to.	8
The receptionists were nice and helpful with everything we needed.	8
For the price of 50 euro/night for a room for 4 people, it was more than expected.	8
However, I wouldn't recommend it for people who want to travel with luxury, just for the ones who need a simple, cheap, clean and convieniently located place to stay.	8
the place is clean and the staff friendly 	9
but three big minus: 	9
1. they charge us (3 persons) ten euros meanwhile other guests in the dorm told us that they paid seven euros	9
 2. and it was too hot so we hard couldn't sleep. Imagine how it is in the summer! The ventilation is bad.	9
3. we couldn't sleep neither 'cause there's a highway right next to the hostel so we heard all night all traffic rush by.	9
I just love this place - not only because of charming "Adonis" Carlo and funny "Entertainer" Giovanni and their honest advice "make it your home!"	10
 It definitely felt like home, cause the atmosphere was relaxed and personal and from the beginning the guys carried over the italian way of life.	10
The rooms are basic but totally cosy and clean and 	10
 the free espresso is just superb, especially when Carlo is preparing it with lots of love.	10
 The hostel is about 5 minutes to town and	10
 in case it rains while you stay there - just ask Giovanni to order the best pizza in town and enjoy it with a glass of good italian vino, because sharing is a matter of course with these great hosts.	10
I`ll come again and not only because of Pisa - 	10
but because of two guys, who love what they do and deserve success and happiness.	10
THANKS guys!	10
My friend and I went to Psa just to hang out and take pics of the Tower and go to other cities in Rome.	11
We had no clue about hwere to stay.	11
We stumbled on Hostel Station at the recommendation of a person we met in a restaurant.	11
I have stayed in Hostels before; some are nice but others can be really bad.	11
This one was WONDERFUL!	11
